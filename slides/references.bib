  abstract = {In empirical work in economics it is common to report standard errors that account for clustering of units. Typically, the motivation given for the clustering adjustments is that unobserved components in outcomes for units within clusters are correlated. However, because correlation may occur across more than one dimension, this motivation makes it difficult to justify why researchers use clustering in some dimensions, such as geographic, but not others, such as age cohorts or gender. This motivation also makes it difficult to explain why one should not cluster with data from a randomized experiment. In this paper, we argue that clustering is in essence a design problem, either a sampling design or an experimental design issue. It is a sampling design issue if sampling follows a two stage process where in the first stage, a subset of clusters were sampled randomly from a population of clusters, and in the second stage, units were sampled randomly from the sampled clusters. In this case the clustering adjustment is justified by the fact that there are clusters in the population that we do not see in the sample. Clustering is an experimental design issue if the assignment is correlated within the clusters. We take the view that this second perspective best fits the typical setting in economics where clustering adjustments are used. This perspective allows us to shed new light on three questions: (i) when should one adjust the standard errors for clustering, (ii) when is the conventional adjustment for clustering appropriate, and (iii) when does the conventional adjustment of the standard errors matter.},

In this paper, I write about a recurring phenomenon in real life that is consistent with Prospect Theory predictions in decision-making loss domain. The 60 cases noted in this paper are associated with specific risk seekers that had cost more than \$140 billion (an average of \$2.33 billion per case). Given space consider-ations, I provide synopses for 14 cases. A few of these cases have been discussed in the extant literature in connection with internal control, but were not considered from the perspective of Prospect Theory. It is striking that these cases are costly, all participants are young men, and almost all had followed the gambler's martingale strategy - i.e., double down. While these cases are informative about risk-seeking behavior, they are not sufficiently systematic to be subjected to stylized archival research methods.},

The two questions most asked about boards are what determines their makeup and what determines their actions? These questions are fundamentally intertwined, which complicates the study of boards because makeup and actions are jointly endogenous. A focus of this survey is how the literature, theoretical as well as empirical, deals\textemdash or on occasions fails to deal\textemdash with this complication. We suggest that many studies of boards can best be interpreted as joint statements about both the director-selection process and the effect of board composition on board actions and firm performance.

It shows how such identities can flatten reward schedules, as they solve "principal-agent" problem.

There is limited empirical evidence about the determinants of cynicism toward change. In this paper, a model is proposed which identifies three key trust-related antecedents of cynicism toward change: perceptions of integrity, competence, and trust in senior management. Data were collected from two Public Sector organizations to identify levels and correlates of cynicism toward change and to test the proposed model. The results of confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling suggest that perceptions of integrity and trust in senior management influence cynicism toward change. Integrity, as an element of trustworthiness, was found to directly influence trust in senior management as well as cynicism toward change. Contrary to expectations, employee perceptions of the competence of senior management did not to have a direct influence on trust nor on cynicism toward change. Collectively the antecedent variables accounted for approximately forty percent of the variance in cynicism toward change. In general terms, the findings will prove helpful to human resource practitioners interested in diagnosing and managing organizational trust and attitudes toward organizational change.}

Evidence of management replacement and significant differences between state-owned and privatized firms from a survey of eastern German firms supports model assumptions and predictions.

However, bonus plans typically pay for performance relative to a goal, and the manager whose performance is to be evaluated often participates in setting the goal. In these settings, PFP affects managers' incentive to influence goal levels in addition to affecting performance effort. Prior field research is silent on the effect of PFP on goals, the focus of this paper. Using sales and sales goal data from 61 stores of a U.S. retail firm over 10 quarters, we find that the introduction of a performance-based bonus plan with participative goal setting is accompanied by lower goals that are more accurate predictors of subsequent sales performance. Statistical tests indicate that increased goal accuracy is attributable to managers ``meeting but not beating'' goals and to new information being impounded in goals. We further investigate how differences among managers are associated with goal levels. We find significant ``manager effects'' but no ``supervisor effects.'' In additional tests we find that cross-sectional differences among managers are related to differing marginal returns to slack-building effort. Turning to the role of new information on goals, we find that prior period performance has incremental power to explain goal levels in the postplan period. Our results provide field-based evidence that PFP and participative goal setting affect the level and accuracy of goals, effects that are associated with both information exchange and with managers' incentives to influence goals.},

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein-protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \textbackslash AA for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Several guidelines for communicating the results of accounting research are offered, and these are broken down by the typical sections and subsections that are (or should be) included in well-written accounting research papers.

We propose an alternative explanation for vertical ownership, namely that it promotes efficient intrafirm transfers of intangible inputs. We show evidence consistent with this hypothesis, including the fact that, after a change of ownership, an acquired establishment begins to resemble the acquiring firm along multiple dimensions.

  abstract = {This paper studies alternative empirical strategies for estimating the effects of organization design practices on performance, as well as the factors which determine organizational design, in a cross-section of firms. Our economic model is based on a firm where multiple organizational design practices are en endogenously determined, and these organizational design practices affect output through an 'organizational design production function.' The econometric model includes unobserved exogenous variation in the costs and returns to each of the individual practices. The model is used to evaluate how different econometric strategies for testing theories about complementarity can be interpreted under alternative assumptions about the economic and statistical environment. We identify plausible hypotheses about the joint distribution of the unobservables under which several different approaches from the existing literature will yield biased and inconsistent estimates. We show that the sign of the bias depends on two factors: whether the organzational design practices are complements, and the correlation between the unobserved returns to each practice. We find several sets of conditions under which the sign of the bias can be determined, and we provide economic interpretations. Our analysis shows that for a particular set of hypotheses, a variety of different procedures may all yield qualitatively similar biases, presenting a challenge for the identification of complementarity. We then propose a structural approach, which is based on a system of simultaneous equations describing productivity and the demand for organizational design practices. As long as exogenous variables are observed which are uncorrelated with the unobserved returns to practices, the structural parameters are identified, yielding consistent tests for complementarity as well as the cross-equation restrictions implied by static optimization of the organizatin's profit function.},

We provide a data-driven approach to partition the data into subpopulations that differ in the magnitude of their treatment effects. The approach enables the construction of valid confidence intervals for treatment effects, even with many covariates relative to the sample size, and without "sparsity" assumptions. We propose an "honest" approach to estimation, whereby one sample is used to construct the partition and another to estimate treatment effects for each subpopulation. Our approach builds on regression tree methods, modified to optimize for goodness of fit in treatment effects and to account for honest estimation. Our model selection criterion anticipates that bias will be eliminated by honest estimation and also accounts for the effect of making additional splits on the variance of treatment effect estimates within each subpopulation. We address the challenge that the "ground truth" for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit, so that standard approaches to cross-validation must be modified. Through a simulation study, we show that for our preferred method honest estimation results in nominal coverage for 90\% confidence intervals, whereas coverage ranges between 74\% and 84\% for nonhonest approaches. Honest estimation requires estimating the model with a smaller sample size; the cost in terms of mean squared error of treatment effects for our preferred method ranges between 7-22\%.},

Based on a review of the psychological theories and empirical findings which relate mood to decision making and information processing, we derive hypotheses with respect to the impact of good, neutral, and bad moods on the behavior of traders. Two experiments (N = 66 and 72) were conducted on an Internet platform which simulated foreign exchange trading based on historical market data. The first experiment manipulated mood using feedback and music whereas the second one asked subjects to read mood-laden statements. It was found that traders in a good mood had an inferior trading performance (losing money) compared to those in a neutral or bad mood (making profit). This is because traders in a good mood made less accurate decisions than those in neutral or bad moods. Those in a bad mood were the most accurate in their decisions but behaved conservatively in their trading. Subjects in a good mood tended to make less accurate decisions though they spent on average at least the same time as the other subjects on information processing and decision-making. They also were over-confident taking unwarranted risks. The studies concluded with insights concerning the effects of mood on choice of trading strategies. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

On the one hand, telecommuting may impede information acquisition due to reduced communication with colleagues. On the other hand, telecommuting may facilitate information acquisition due to relaxed time pressure (via not having to commute) and increased attentional resources (via quieter and uninterrupted working environments). I find employees' acquisition of new information increases following telecommuting. Further, I find this effect is greater for employees under greater time pressure and employees experiencing greater distractions at the workplace before telecommuting, and find telecommuting causes adverse consequences for employees least responsive to organizations' incentive systems. Finally, I find work quality improves following telecommuting. My results suggest telecommuting benefits employees performing knowledge-intensive tasks by facilitating employees' information acquisition.},

  abstract = {Relational contracts\textemdash informal agreements sustained by the value of future relationships\textemdash are prevalent within and between firms. We develop repeated-game models showing why and how relational contracts within firms (vertical integration) differ from those between (nonintegration). We show that integration affects the parties' temptations to renege on a given relational contract, and hence affects the best relational contract the parties can sustain. In this sense, the integration decision can be an instrument in the service of the parties' relationship. Our approach also has implications for joint ventures, alliances, and networks, and for the role of management within and between firms.},

Committing to higher audit fees (a measure of financial statement verification) is associated with management forecasts that are more frequent, specific, timely, accurate and informative to investors. Because private information disclosure and audited financial reporting are complements, their economic roles cannot be evaluated separately. Our evidence cautions against drawing inferences exclusively from market reactions around ``announcement periods'' because audited financial reporting indirectly affects information released at other times and through other channels.}

In comparative validation analyses, three or more loose stools or any number of loose stools containing blood in a 24-hour period seemed to be the best definition of diarrhoea. Three intervening diarrhoea-free days seemed to be the optimum to define a new episode. The implications of using differing definitions and the importance of using a validated definition are discussed.},

We also find that country-pair homophily limits the appointments of foreign directors from high-quality governance countries to firms located in low-quality governance countries, which may reduce the role of board internationalization in promoting the global convergence of governance practices. We analyze changes in foreign director appointments around the international adoption of IFRS and Norway's gender-quota rule and find a higher appointment likelihood for directors originating from countries that are institutionally and culturally similar to that of the firm. Our findings point to the critical role that country-pair homophily plays in matching director to boards with implications for the diffusion of governance practices globally.},

Finally, using the staggered adoption of the 150-hour Rule as an example, I briefly review several proposals to adjust for the bias and correctly implement staggered DiD designs that a bourgeoning literature has put forward in econometrics.},

On their own, ability tests correlate with 4 of the 8 competencies, and together ability and personality data yield operational validities ranging from 0.20 to 0.44 for the 8 competencies. Operational validities for aggregated predictors with aggregated criteria were estimated to be 0.53.

Economies with recordkeeping exhibit a beneficially altered economic history where the risks of exchanging with strangers are substantially lessened. Our findings are consistent with prior assertions that complex and extensive reciprocity requires sophisticated memory to store information on past transactions. We offer insights on this research by scientifically demonstrating that reciprocity can be facilitated by information storage external to the brain. This is consistent with the archaeological record, which suggests that prehistoric transaction records and the invention of writing for recordkeeping were linked to increased complexity in human interaction.},

As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters.

We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model.

Although theoretical debate dates back to the seminal paper of Otley (1980), there remains little empirical analysis of how control mechanisms combine. To increase knowledge in this area this study explores how multiple accounting and other control mechanisms commonly combine and the associations these combinations have with firm context. From a cross-sectional sample of 400 firms, this study presents an empirically derived taxonomy of five control configurations used by top managers, labelled as simple, results, action, devolved, and hybrid. Many of these patterns closely resemble control configurations common to the literature, while others represent distinctively contemporary arrangements, such as flexible variants of traditional bureaucracy (action), and instances where multiple and seemingly conflicting control types intermesh (hybrid). In analyzing these configurations this study provides accounting and control researchers with empirical observations to refine and extend existing control frameworks and theory.},

First, this study identifies how a set of MC practices combine (i.e. MC packages) to achieve effective control outcomes for firms operating in defender and prospector strategic contexts by applying fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Using data from a survey of top managers the analysis reveals that there are multiple ways by which firms can effectively combine MC practices in a given strategic context. Furthermore, the analysis shows that not all MC practices found to be relevant in isolation are relevant when examined simultaneously as a package. Second, based on a comparison of effective MC packages this study examines interdependencies between MC practices (i.e. MC systems). Results show that in defender firms a diagnostic control use of accounting and mechanistic structural controls act as complements, while mechanistic structural controls and measure diversity act as substitutes. In prospector firms an interactive control use of accounting and organic structural controls are found to have complementary effects. These results indicate that the effectiveness of accounting control and structural control choices are determined not only by their fit with strategic context but also by how they fit with each other. This study also demonstrates how an understanding of MC packages can provide guidance for theory development and empirical analysis of MC systems.},

Drawing on paradox and organisational conflict literature, this study emphasises the role of cognitive conflict, generated by PMSs, in shaping the relationships between competence ambidexterity and innovation ambidexterity. Based on survey data from a sample of 90 Irish firms, our findings indicate that competence ambidexterity is associated with (a) the choice to have a balanced set of performance measures, and (b) the use of PMSs for frequent and intensive debate between top managers. Furthermore, the study reveals that these choices are interdependent, as they function as complements in generating cognitive conflict, which in turn drives the realisation of innovation ambidexterity outcomes. The results also show that cognitive conflict is not directly associated with the development of competence ambidexterity, but is instead generated through the conjoint action of a balanced PMS design and the use of PMSs for intensive debate. Overall, this study demonstrates the interdependent nature of choices concerning the design and use of PMSs, and the significant role of PMSs as generators of cognitive conflict in firms attempting to achieve ambidexterity.},

Mixed findings, variability in the approaches to account for the levers' combined use, and variability in conceptual choices (e.g., the conceptualization of interactive and diagnostic control) have caused this unsatisfactory state. In response, we validate and extend theory on the LoC framework by meta-analytically synthesizing quantitative evidence from 58 independent samples and 10,374 observations. We develop two models of the combined use of the levers, which portray their simultaneous use and mutual relationships, and relate them to capabilities and performance. For theory validation, we uncover stylized facts that demonstrate that organizations use the four levers in combination, not in isolation. Moreover, following the logic of the resource-based view, the levers are related to performance via capabilities. These relationships are robust to moderating influences of the dimensions and conceptualization of interactive control and managers' hierarchical level. For theory extension, we systematically uncover the need to complement the resource-based view with other theories and offer related suggestions. Our moderator analyses identify boundary conditions that limit the generalizability of the LoC framework. For example, surprisingly, the conceptualization of diagnostic control emerges as a boundary condition. On a general level, our findings might serve as an inspiration for better appreciating future survey-based knowledge creation in management control research and also provide researchers from other disciplines with a more comprehensive understanding of the enhancement of capabilities and performance.},

We hypothesize that firms already exposed to a state FCA whistleblower law are less affected by the Dodd\textendash Frank whistleblower provision. Using the companies exposed to a state FCA as control firms in our Dodd\textendash Frank tests, the remaining firms constitute the treatment sample. We find that exposure to Dodd\textendash Frank reduces the likelihood of accounting fraud of treatment firms by 12\%\textendash 22\% relative to control firms, but do not find that it affects audit fees.},

We then present a longitudinal study of the efforts made by a multi-national industrial firm to align its management control system and sustainability control system in an integrated sustainability strategy. Our results provide three insights into control system integration for sustainability. First, intensive dialogues among managers at different organizational levels and in different organizational functions mitigate challenges to the technical and organizational integration of sustainability along a firm's value chain. Second, the degree to which the firm's strategic-level managers focus on external sustainability drivers influences how well the firm develops and markets sustainability-related products and services. Finally, a committed CEO and strategic-level management can avoid marginalizing sustainability by communicating their beliefs about it through intensive dialogues across management levels. Our results support the position that a firm can manage sustainability by making incremental changes in management control practices.},

It emphasizes that in addressing the conceptual level of the predictive validity framework [Libby, R., Bloomfield, R., \& Nelson, M. (2002). Experimental research in financial accounting. Accounting, Organizations and Society, 27, 775-810], special attention must be paid to two issues: (1) the production of a specific agreed-upon meaning and domain for each construct of interest; and (2) the specification and conceptual justification of the nature and direction of the epistemic relationships between constructs, dimensions and indicators (i.e., reflective vs. formative models; latent vs. emergent models). The paper highlights the importance of both issues especially in the case of practice-defined variables, and it provides guidelines on how to address both aspects of conceptual specification. While the issues raised are pertinent to many research areas, the paper concentrates on the implications for management accounting and control systems (MACS) research, using interactive use of control systems [Simons, R. (1995a). Levers of control. Boston: Harvard Business School Press] to illustrate how researchers should go about specifying meaning and epistemic relationships in MACS research. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Following Slavin's (1995) suggestions, we have implemented the ``best evidence synthesis'' method that appears to be the most relevant. It allows us to conclude, on the whole, that budgetary participation has no significant impact on managerial performance. Finally cultural and temporal contingencies have also been discussed so as to explain the heterogeneity resulting from these different studies.},

However, several recent empirical studies and game theoretic models of bargaining contradict these findings. This paper seeks to develop a comprehensive explanation of the role of framing that will reconcile the various results. Because of the conflict between integrative and distributive aspects of bargaining, negotiators must confront a dilemma. Risk attitude and framing affect the approach negotiators take in dealing with the dilemma. Contrary to the view taken in the early framing studies, negatively framed bargainers should generally do better than their positively framed counterparts in most situations. However, a pair of positively framed bargainers should reach more integrative settlements than a pair of negatively framed bargainers. Two experiments are reported that tested these propositions. In each case the predictions were strongly supported. The implications of these results for theorists and negotiators are discussed.},

We review the most salient empirical facts and arguments that give credence to the idea that market price fluctuations are mostly due to order flow, whether informed or non-informed. We show that the Latent Liquidity Theory of price impact makes a precise prediction for GK's multiplier M , which measures by how many dollars, on average, the market value of a company goes up if one buys one dollar worth of its stocks. Our central result is that M is of order unity, as found by GK, and increases with the volatility of the stock and decreases with the fraction of the market cap. traded daily. We discuss several empirical results suggesting that the lion's share of volatility is due to trading activity. We argue that the IMH holds for all asset classes, beyond the case of stock markets considered by GK.},

ABSTRACT Using a sample of 140 managers, we investigate the use of various perfor-mance metrics in determining the periodic assessment, bonus decisions, and career paths of business unit managers. We show that the weight on account-ing return measures is associated with the authority of these managers, and we document that both disaggregated measures (expenses and revenues), and nonfinancial measures play a greater role as interdependencies between business units increase. The results suggest separate and distinct roles for dif-ferent types of performance measures. Accounting return measures are used to create the proper incentives for managers with greater authority, while disaggregated and nonfinancial measures are employed in response to inter-dependencies.},

Specifically, we are interested in variation in the relative incentive weightings of aggregated ``above-level'' measures (e.g., firm-wide net income), ``own-level'' business unit measures (e.g., business unit profit), and specific ``below-level'' measures (e.g., R\&D expenses) in response to spillover arising from either the focal unit's effect on other business units or the other units' effect on the focal unit. Our theory highlights complementarity between above- and below-level measures and the existence of an interaction between the two directions of spillovers. Based on a survey of 122 business unit managers, we report evidence consistent with an interaction effect and with complementarity between above- and below-level measures. In particular, we show that firms increase the weighting on both above- and below-level measures when they are coping simultaneously with high levels of spillovers on other units and spillovers from other units.

We also demonstrate that store managers who receive a favorable subjective performance evaluation are more likely to sustain or even improve their sales performance in the future. We find some evidence that suggests that incorporating subjective information improves the accuracy of sales targets. Together the results suggest that the congruence of target-setting improves if subjective appraisals of performance are used as an information source to set financial targets.},

This may occur when incentives adversely affect individuals' altruism, ethical norms, intrinsic motives to serve the public, and other social preferences. The opposite also occurs\textemdash crowding in\-\textemdash though it appears less commonly. In the fifty experiments that we survey, these effects are common, so that incentives and social preferences may be either substitutes (crowding out) or complements (crowding in). We provide evidence for four mechanisms that may account for these incentive effects on preferences: namely that incentives may (i) provide information about the person who implemented the incentive, (ii) frame the decision situation so as to suggest appropriate behavior, (iii) compromise a control averse individual's sense of autonomy, and (iv) affect the process by which people learn new preferences. An implication is that the evaluation of public policy must be restricted to allocations that are supportable as Nash equilibria when account is taken of these crowding effects. We show that well designed fines, subsidies, and the like minimize crowding out and may even do the opposite, making incentives and social preferences complements rather than substitutes.

This holds both in aggregate and individually, and it explains the BOS-threshold: Semi-Grim equilibria appear as the discount factor crosses this threshold, and then, subjects start cooperating in round 1 and switch to Semi-Grim in continuation play.

  abstract = {We review accounting and finance research on corporate governance (CG). In the course of our review, we focus on a particularly vexing issue, namely endogeneity in the relationships between CG and other matters of concern to accounting and finance scholars, and suggest ways to deal with it. Given the advent of large commercial CG databases, we also stress the importance of how CG is measured and in particular, the construction of CG indices, which should be sensitive to local institutional arrangements, and the need to capture both internal and external aspects of governance. The `stickiness' of CG characteristics provides an additional challenge to CG scholars. Better theory is required, for example, to explain whether various CG practices substitute for each other or are complements. While a multidisciplinary approach to developing better theory is never without its difficulties, it could enrich the current body of knowledge in CG. Despite the vastness of the existing CG literature, these issues do suggest a number of avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {In this study, we ask: how does the intensity of internal competition for resources affect the communication of private information in an organization? Although competition between different divisions or units for resources is pervasive in many organizations, much of the accounting literature examines non-competitive resource allocation and thus does not provide guidance on this point. To address this question, we conduct an experiment in which a principal allocates capital among three agents, who can each propose a single project. In the high (medium, low) competition condition, principals have sufficient funds to accept only one (only two, all three) projects. We test three competing predictions based on prior literature: (1) Agents will make maximum credible misrepresentations under both medium and high competition, in order to maximize their chance of receiving capital. (2) Agents will weigh the disutility of misrepresentation against the expected utility of receiving project funding, resulting in more misrepresentation at medium than at high levels of competition, because the probability of receiving funding is lower in high competition. (3) Misrepresentation will be highest in high competition, because agents will interpret the high-competition setting as one in which misrepresentation is most necessary to win funding and most socially appropriate. Consistent with the second prediction, misrepresentation is highest in medium competition. These results suggest that a medium level of competition is a less favorable setting for voluntary information-sharing than either uncompetitive or high competition settings, and therefore costly formal enforcement mechanisms such as post-audits are likely to be more valuable in medium-competition settings. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Missing data is a prevalent, yet often ignored, feature of company fundamentals. In this paper, we document the structure of missing financial data and show how to systematically deal with it. In a comprehensive empirical study we establish four key stylized facts. First, the issue of missing financial data is profound: it affects over 70\% of firms that represent about half of the total market cap. Second, the problem becomes particularly severe when requiring multiple characteristics to be present. Third, firm fundamentals are not missing-at-random, invalidating traditional ad-hoc approaches to data imputation and sample selection. Fourth, stock returns themselves depend on missingness. We propose a novel imputation method to obtain a fully observed panel of firm fundamentals. It exploits both time-series and cross-sectional dependency of firm characteristics to impute their missing values, while allowing for general systematic patterns of missing data. Our approach provides a substantial improvement over the standard leading empirical procedures such as using cross-sectional averages or past observations. Our results have crucial implications for many areas of asset pricing.},

We also address some confusing arguments in the literature concerning the moderation form of fit and what has been referred as the mediation form of fit. In a second step, we reevaluate the appropriateness of statistical techniques used to test sub-forms of fit, highlighting the difficulties in differentiating conclusively between them. Specifically, we present polynomial regression analysis (PRA) in conjunction with the response surface methodology (RSM) as a powerful methodological alternative and discuss its ability to differentiate between the sub-forms of fit. We also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of structural equation modeling (SEM) to test for forms of fit. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

We identify and label one of these individual cognitive differences comprehensive thinking ability: the ability to think about multiple paths, branches or alternatives. Significant comprehensive thinking ability is likely to mitigate systematic differences in judgment in many contexts. We report the results of a series of studies using a variation on the investment trap (sunk cost or irrelevant cost) problem and a probability revision task. The findings suggest that comprehensive thinking ability may also explain other common systematic differences in judgment.},

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference.

We exploit a field-research setting in which business units vary in the "tightness" with which they monitor employee decisions. We find that tighter monitoring gives rise to implicit incentives in the form of sharp increases in employee termination linked to "excessive" use of decision-rights. Consistent with these implicit incentives, we find that employees in tightly monitored business units are less likely than their loosely monitored counterparts to: (1) use decision-rights; and (2) adjust for hard information, in the form of historical performance data, in their decisions. These decision-making patterns are associated with large and systematic differences in learning rates across business units. Learning is concentrated in business units with "loose monitoring" and entirely absent in those with "tight monitoring." The results are consistent with an experimentation hypothesis in which tight monitoring of decisions leads to more control but less learning.

In a fully crossed two-by-two design, we manipulate the participants' private cost report quality as either low or high, representing the extent to which these reports reveal that product markets have different overhead costs. We show that when only the leader is given a high-quality cost report, private cost information of higher quality is better incorporated into market prices (that are observable to participants). Both the leader and follower improve in prof- its and their prices better reflect the differences in overhead costs because the follower infers information from the leader's prices (information leakage). In contrast, when only the follower receives a high-quality cost report, the leader's profits and prices do not improve. This occurs because the follower conceals cost information when the leader has a low-quality cost report.},

However, the factors that may facilitate (or inhibit) cost system changes towards ABC have not yet been disentangled in a specific hospital context. Via a survey study of hospitals, we discovered that cost system development in hospitals could largely be explained by hospital specific factors. Issues such as the support of the medical parties towards cost system use, the awareness of problems with the existing legal cost system, the type of contract for the physician's internal financial agreement, should be considered if hospitals refine their cost system. Conversely, ABC-adoption issues that were found to be crucial in other industries are less important. Apparently, installing a cost system requires a different approach in hospital settings. Especially, results suggest that hospital management should not underestimate the interest of the physician in the process of redesigning cost systems. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Specifically, the results show that participants overstate cost less when the manager's cost report de-termines whether the firm earns a gain or loss than when their report does not affect whether the firm earns a profit or loss (i.e., the firm always earns either a profit or loss regardless of the cost report). Further, the results suggest that the impact of the earnings situation on the degree of honesty depends on whether the firm uses an information system that improves its ability to detect misreporting. Specifically, the earnings situation has less effect on the degree of honesty when the firm uses an information system. This is because the information system decreases honesty when the manager's report determines whether the firm earns a profit or loss but increases it otherwise.

We conduct two experiments, in which participants act as senior executives charged with evaluating two business-unit managers. Performance differences between business units are contained in either a financial or one of the three non-financial categories. Specifically, the first experiment studies how organizing measures in a Balanced Scorecard (BSC) format affects performance evaluations. Our results show that when the performance differences are contained in the financial category, evaluators that use a BSC-format place more weight on financial category measures than evaluators using an unformatted scorecard. Conversely, when performance differences are contained in the non-financial categories, whether measures are organized into a BSC-format or into an unformatted scorecard has no impact on the evaluation. The second experiment shows that when performance markers are added to the scorecards (i.e., +, -, and = signs for above-target, below-target, and on-target performance), evaluators that use a BSC-format weight measures in any category containing a performance difference more heavily than evaluators using an unformatted scorecard. Our findings suggest that firms should carefully consider how to present and organize measures to get the intended effect on performance evaluations. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

We use our empirical methodology to analyze complementarity between innovation activities: internal research and development (R\&D) and external knowledge acquisition. Our results suggest that internal R\&D and external knowledge acquisition are complementary innovation activities, but that the degree of complementarity is sensitive to other elements of the firm's strategic environment.

Profit comparisons, market prices and managers' judgments about negotiated transfer prices. The Accounting Review, 72(2), 217-229] found that because of the existence of self-serving biases, negotiating managers have different expectations regarding what constitutes a 'fair' transfer price, leading to a less efficient negotiation process. In this study, we examine two factors that are expected to affect managers' transfer price negotiation judgments, namely, framing as a gain or as a loss and the negotiation partner's objective (whether the partner's objective involves high or low concern-for-others). We propose that these two factors affect managers' perceptions of the negotiation context, and thus the way they interpret the economic and social consequences of accounting information. Our results show that a loss frame (compared to a gain frame) exacerbates managers' self-serving biases and increases the 'transfer price expectation gap' between buyers and sellers. Further, in our experiment where market price is higher than equal-profit price, we find that managers' transfer price expectations are lower (and deviate more from the prevailing market price) when they are negotiating with a partner with high concern-for-others than with a partner with low concern-for-others. We discuss the broader implications of these results for the design of management accounting systems. Crown Copyright ?? 2008.},

We propose that employee sensemaking triggered by strong organizational values can increase the risk of attributions of leader hypocrisy, which lead to employee disenchantment in a process we call the hypocrisy attribution dynamic. Value expansion, organizational tenure, and perceived benefit/harm are proposed to moderate the hypocrisy attribution dynamic, influencing the chances of negative sensemaking about leaders' behavior.

  abstract = {We examine whether restricting managers' discretion through GAAP impacts the usefulness of accounting information in debt contracting. Our study informs standard setters and regulators regarding the debt contracting implications of limiting managers' discretion via accounting standards. We predict and find that under more restrictive standards, lenders make more non-GAAP modifications to GAAP-based performance measures, suggesting that restrictions of managers' discretion reduce the usefulness of accounting information. We perform two additional analyses to enhance identification. First, in line-item-level analysis, we document a positive relation between the exclusion of specific nonrecurring items from contractual definitions of earnings and the number of restrictions in the GAAP standards that apply to each specific item each year. Second, using difference-in-differences tests around standard changes, we find that the propensity to exclude items varies positively with changes in the restrictiveness of related standards. Moreover, we predict and find that restrictive standards are also positively associated with loan spreads but significantly less so when lenders adjust GAAP numbers in loan contracts. Overall, this study improves our understanding of how attributes of accounting standards impact the usefulness of accounting information.},

Researchers have attempted to explain the effectiveness of MCS by examining designs that best suit the nature of the environment, technology, size, structure, strategy and national culture. In recent years, contingency-based research has maintained its popularity with studies including these variables but redefining them in contemporary terms. This paper provides a critical review of findings from contingency-based studies over the past 20 years, deriving a series of propositions relating MCS to organizational context. The paper examines issues related to the purpose of MCS, the elements of MCS, the meaning and measurement of contextual variables, and issues concerning theory development. A final section considers the possibility that contingency-based ideas could encompass insights from a variety of theories to help understand MCS within its organizational context.},

This paper aims to stimulate debate as to the meaning of endogeneity as it applies to (management) accounting research. The paper explains what endogeneity is, its causes and consequences, and potential ways of managing the problem. Specifically, the paper argues that an econometric definition of endogeneity clarifies its meaning in empirical research. A series of basic issues that concern endogeneity and theory construction are presented. These include omitted variables, simultaneity, equilibrium conditions and issues concerning choice variables. Finally, possible approaches for dealing with endogeneity are presented.}

They are generally treated as two unrelated topics in the literature. The present article proposes a model to integrate fixed-, random-, and mixed-effects meta-analyses into the SEM framework. By applying an appropriate transformation on the data, studies in a meta-analysis can be analyzed as subjects in a structural equation model. This article also highlights some practical benefits of using the SEM approach to conduct a meta-analysis. Specifically, the SEM-based meta-analysis can be used to handle missing covariates, to quantify the heterogeneity of effect sizes, and to address the heterogeneity of effect sizes with mixture models. Examples are used to illustrate the equivalence between the conventional meta-analysis and the SEM-based meta-analysis. Future directions on and issues related to the SEM-based meta-analysis are discussed.},

A combination of richer data and robust, theory-driven restrictions is required. We illustrate this on leading applications. (JEL C57, C78)}

Notably, trust and reciprocity can promote a "gift exchange" between employers and workers. Using an experiment, I investigate whether labor market competition moderates the emergence of a gift exchange in labor markets in which signing bonus offers serve as a potential signal of trust and the duration of the employment relationship is endogenously determined. I find that offering a signing bonus more positively affects both workers' beliefs about the employer's trust in them and their effort when there is an excess supply of workers than when there is an excess demand for workers. I also find that the initial effects of signing bonuses may not persist over time. Additional analyses suggest that both employers' and workers' expectations may affect whether and how trust and reciprocity develop over time. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

When division managers are evaluated using a competitive performance evaluation scheme, a supportive leadership tone leads to a higher likelihood that divisions will settle on a transfer price close to the equal-profit transfer price. In contrast, when division managers are evaluated using a cooperative performance evaluation scheme, leadership tone does not significantly affect the likelihood that divisions settle on an equal-profit transfer price. These results demonstrate that firms, maintaining individual performance evaluations in a decentralized company structure, can use an informal control such as leadership tone to manage negotiation conflicts.},

  abstract = {A key ingredient of many popular asset pricing models is that investors exhibit coun- tercyclical risk aversion, which helps explain major puzzles in financial economics such as the strong and systematic variation in risk premiums over time and the high volatility of asset prices. There is, however, surprisingly little evidence for this as- sumption because it is difficult to control for the host of factors that change simulta- neously during financial booms and busts. We circumvent these control problems by priming financial professionals with either a boom or a bust scenario and by subse- quently measuring their risk aversion in two experimental investment tasks with real monetary stakes. Subjects who were primed with a financial bust were substantially more risk averse than those who were primed with a boom. Subjects were also more fearful in the bust than in the boom condition, and their fear is negatively related to investments in the risky asset, suggesting that fear may play an important role in countercyclical risk aversion. The mechanism described in this paper is relevant for theory and has important implications for financial markets, as it provides the basis for a self-reinforcing process that amplifies market dynamics.},

We manually collect new data on the details of thousands of corruption cases, through which we uncover a large heterogeneity in our firm-level effects depending on the degree of involvement in corruption. Using investment-, loan-, and worker- level data, we show that the average exposed firms adapt to the loss of government contracts by changing their investment strategy. They increase capital investment and borrow more to finance such investment, while there is no change in their internal organization. We provide qualitative support to our results by conducting new face-to-face surveys with business owners of government-dependent firms.},

  abstract = {Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have become increasingly common. However, reported failure rates are high, underlining the challenge to effectively govern such relationships. The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the management control structure for different types of PPPs by adopting a comparative case study approach. The two cases under study are partnerships between municipalities and their private partners: a long-term infrastructure project and an urban regeneration project. Given the different nature of the activities and the accompanying risks, the PPP literature suggests that the cooperation in these PPPs is organized in very different ways, namely loose versus tight. We propose (1) that outcome-based control mechanisms play an important role in managing loosely organized PPP projects and (2) that behaviour and social control mechanisms play an important role in managing tightly organized PPP projects. Although our results support these propositions, our analysis also suggests that existing frameworks for private inter-organizational relationships (IORs) are insufficient for explaining governance structures in PPPs. Given the specific nature of PPP arrangements, we identify a number of socio-political risks and related management control mechanisms not typically discussed in theories of private IORs. More specifically, we conclude that conveners and project champions play an important role as political controls in the success of PPPs.}

The authors' main message is that most if not all of these concerns are exaggerated by the popular tendency to focus on the annual income of CEOs (consisting of salary, bonus, and stock and option grants) while ignoring their existing holdings of company equity. Taking into account the effect of stock price changes on CEO wealth leads the authors to a number of interesting conclusions. First, the pay-for-performance relationship is strong and has grown significantly in recent years. Second, what may appear as above-normal growth in annual pay levels may be necessary to compensate CEOs for the increased risk associated with their growing level of equity-based incentives. Third, conventional (that is, unindexed) stock and options, when viewed as a combination of market risk and firm-specific risk, may provide an optimal solution to two conflicting demands: shareholders' demand for executive rewards tied to company performance and executives' preference to diversify their wealth. Finally, there is little evidence of widespread CEO unwinding of incentives, and levels of CEO equity ownership in the U.S. remain impressively high.},

This purpose is achieved through mechanisms that inspire (inspirational controls) these dialogues and mechanisms that configure (directional controls) the way they happen. Our research is based on a multi-case research design structured around an in-depth case study where the main traits of these systems are identified, followed up by five additional cases that reinforce, reshape, and enrich the findings.

External purchases of products and services generally account for more than 50 percent of total costs. Significant cost savings can be realized by effectively selecting suppliers and determining optimal order quantities. Existing cost management tools focus on rationalizing production and distribution activities and do not consider the purchasing function. In practice, simple, subjective, and incomplete approaches for supplier selection are often used. This article presents a rigorous decision support system using total cost of ownership information. The system uses a dynamic mathematical programming model that derives a purchasing strategy by minimizing the total costs, taking into account the relevant constraints. It allows the purchasing and supply manager to objectively evaluate alternative policies. A recent implementation of the system for two product groups at Cockerill Sambre shows potential savings of more than 10 percent compared to current practices.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT In this study, we examine how firms' collaborative objectives influence their use of performance management practices in interfirm relationships. We conceptualize collaborative performance management to include three interrelated practices: measurement of interfirm performance, information sharing, and interaction between boundary spanners of partner firms. Prior research has related firms' interfirm control choices to transaction risk as proxied by ``given'' transaction characteristics. We hypothesize that transaction characteristics are determined by the strategic importance of the collaboration (manifested by the importance of firms' collaborative objectives) and, in turn, influence the use of firms' performance management practices. Analysis of survey data supports our hypotheses that strategic importance of the collaboration is associated with transaction characteristics (i.e., with asset specificity, transaction scope, task interdependencies, and environmental variability), which, in turn, me...},

In particular, we examine the implications of firms' joint strategic emphasis on both low cost and differentiation for their use of performance measurement and incentive compensation. Analysis of survey data of 387 firms shows that more than half of the sample to some extent or fully mixes strategic priorities, while strategic priorities resembling strategic archetypes (primarily low cost or differentiation) populate only 36 percent of the sample. Our analyses support that, as compared to archetypal strategies, pursuing mixed strategies elicits design of more comprehensive and complex PMSs that are aimed at balancing effort and decisions toward the multiple strategies pursued.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, accounting researchers have shown significant interest in interfirm relationships; in particular in the implications for management accounting and control practices to manage these relationships. Analysis of the growing literature on interfirm management accounting suggests this is developing largely independently from the literature on accounting and control in intrafirm settings, with only limited recognition of potential interrelations. A key reason for this seems to relate to the different types of research questions and related levels of analysis that studies in these areas focus on. Particularly, while intrafirm studies focus primarily on questions related to units, people, practices and processes within organizations, interfirm studies focus predominantly on questions related to the management of collaboration with partner firms and of partner behavior. This paper reviews how intrafirm and interfirm management accounting research to date connect, and how they could connect better. The review identifies three areas of connection that are addressed to only a limited extent by prior research: (1) management accounting within interfirm relationships aimed at aligning the interests and actions of boundary spanners, (2) interrelations between intrafirm and interfirm management accounting, and (3) the use of intrafirm management control frameworks to analyze interfirm control. For each of these areas, the paper reviews insights obtained from prior studies and offers directions for future research.},

Key aspects of the setting of performance targets are how specific they should be and at which levels they should be set. We develop a structural model that aims to explain the specificity of targets set for subordinate managers and the information sources used to set target levels for defined performance dimensions, which sources include past performance, future planning, and benchmarking information. An analysis of 364 survey responses provides support for our expectations that both target specificity and the use of information sources to determine target levels vary with firms' environmental dynamism and task uncertainty, and with the intensity of financial incentives provided to subordinate managers. In addition, the results show that in response to these contextual variables, firms typically combine information sources to determine adequate target levels, instead of treating them as substitutes.

In addition, trading volume is 8\% lower around Friday announcements. These findings support explanations of post-earnings announcement drift based on underreaction to information caused by limited attention.},

We analyse a cross-industry panel of 531 firms from the 2007\textendash 2013 Carbon Disclosure Project investor survey. In line with predictions from the management control literature, we find that the use of green incentives is positively associated with a firm's experience in monitoring environmental performance, supporting a sequential model of management control systems' implementation. We also find that conformity pressure to industry peer practices and to enhancing environmental performance affects the firm's use of green incentives in accordance with social conformity theory. We further find that green incentives behave differently across the organizational hierarchy. Consistent with managerial and social arguments explaining time-to-adoption of management practices across organizations, we also observe that green strategy and monitoring experience are associated with an earlier adoption of green incentives. Conversely, conformity pressure to industry peer practices predicts a later adoption.},

Drawing from the dual concern model (D. G. Pruitt \& J. Z.

In contrast to earlier findings, there was strong support for the use of structured interviewing. Interviews were most commonly undertaken by HR and line staff. Typically applicants underwent more than one interview and at each, were interviewed by two to three interviewers. Cognitive tests were more frequently used than personality assessments. There was some support for personality assessments based on the Five Factor Model but there was similar support for measures without published psychometric properties. In general, the government sector made greater use of structured interviewing, conducted a single interview with two to three interviewers present and made use of better quality assessment tools compared to other sectors. Recommendations are made for future studies.},

  abstract = {The present study provided data on the cross-national use of management selection methods by collecting information from the Australian context. The data is compared with the British and French findings obtained by Shackleton and Newell (1991). A total of 254 companies (53.4\%) responded to the survey. The overall pattern of results indicated that Australian management selection methods were closer to the British than to the French findings. Compared to previous Australian studies, the present data indicated that the main selection tools being used are unchanged. Some evidence was found that selection methods may differ within organizations comprising the private sector and between the private and public sector. The business sector made significantly greater use of cognitive testing and assessment centres compared to manufacturing, retail and government sectors. The government sector reported a significant difference in using two or three interviewers. It is proposed that, although surveys of this type have been useful as general reviews of the area, future research would benefit by collecting: (1) data on the specific measures used, (2) distinguishing between internal and external recruitment, (3) distinguishing between private and public sector recruitment, and (4) ensuring respondents have the same conceptual understanding of the selection methods covered by the survey.},

The conceptual framework is based on two perspectives-transaction cost economics and relational exchange view. The empirical research analyses three case studies of buyer firms: one in a situation of favorable asymmetric dependence (lordship) and two in a situation of unfavorable asymmetric dependence (vassalage). Three major findings stem from this research. First, the lord buyer mainly exerts a market-based control. This pattern is blended with a bureaucracy-based control to take maximum advantage of interfirm transactional relationships and with a social-based control to strengthen over time cooperation at the operational level. Second, the vassal buyer can only exert social-based control to reduce its transaction risk. Third, the relational behaviors of the most dependent partners seem to be strategies to moderate the negative effects of their dependence. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The highest ranked strategic motives of the Chinese firms are maintaining market position, international expansion, and technology exchange. In contrast, the major strategic motives for alliance formation of the foreign firms are characterised by market penetration and learning how to operate successfully in China. As anticipated the relative importance of strategic motives for ISA formation is found to vary between Chinese firms and foreign firms. We also examine aspects of partner selection criteria for ISA formation from the perspective of Chinese partners. Findings show that the task-related selection criteria are determined more by the strategic motives for ISA formation than are the partner-related selection criteria. This confirms that task-related selection criteria tend to be specific to the alliance whereas partner-related selection criteria are more general in nature. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This negative externality is stronger when the relatively higher taxed competitors (1) are financially constrained, (2) operate in more competitive markets, (3) have similar products to their lower taxed rivals, (4) face rivals that retain more of their cash tax savings due to lower dividends and share repurchases, and (5) face lower taxed, but financially constrained, rivals.

Based on inequity aversion, strategic uncertainty, and risk dominance criteria, we expect negotiators to be more reluctant to share fine information than coarse, less detailed information, which suggests that fine information systems can exacerbate hold-ups. When negotiators share fine information they achieve more efficient bargaining agreements. However, we find that strategic concerns about inequitable outcomes (fear of opportunistic behavior) lead fewer negotiating pairs to share fine information (where inequitable outcomes can be larger) than coarse information (where inequitable outcomes are smaller). Our results demonstrate that information fineness leads negotiators to trade-off potential utility losses due to fairness considerations and potential monetary gains. Fewer (more) negotiators chose to share fine (coarse) information and thus minimize fairness based utility losses (maximize monetary gains). PUBLICATION ABSTRACT},

Consistent with firms improving their workplace practices to remain competitive in the labor market, we find that such improvement concentrates in firms with negative initial reviews and with high labor intensity. We also find firms increase disclosures about workplace practices after being reviewed and the increase concentrates in firms with high institutional ownership, consistent with firms providing more disclosures to appease investors. Overall, our findings suggest that the increased workplace transparency through social media has a disciplinary effect on corporate policies.},

We analyze archival records of the government's evaluation scores, score adjustments, and evaluation ratings given to 63 SOEs between 2005 and 2007. These analyses are also interpreted based on insights gained from in-depth field interviews with SASAC officials and chief financial officers (CFOs) of SOEs. Results indicate that the political connection of SOE CFOs, the geographic proximity of SOE headquarters to the SASAC central office, and political rank of the firm affect the SASAC's evaluations.

  abstract = {A major concern in the literature is that participation by subordinates may result in the generation of slack bud- gets (Antle and Eppen 1985). In one of the earliest studies, Williamson (1964) concluded that subordinate managers will try to influence the budget-setting process and obtain slack budgets. In conformance with Merchant (1985a), Lukka (1988), and Young (1985), budgetary slack Is defined as the express incorporation of budget amounts that make it easier to attain. Managers may build slack Into budgets by strategies that understate revenues and overstate costs (Schiff and Lewin 1970). Whether budgetary slack is a likely outcome in all participatively set budgets is a matter of conjecture. Lukka (1988) argued that a high degree of participation gives subordinate managers the opportunity to contribute directly to the creation of slack, and vice versa. However, the link between participation and slack is equivocal, since Cammann (1976), Merchant (1985a), and Onsi (1973) provide evidence that participation may lead to a reduction in slack, which can be attributed to the positive communication between managers so that subordinates feel less pressure to create slack. The literature proposes a link between participation and budgetary slack through two variables: superiors' budget emphasis in their evaluation of subordinate performance, and the degree of Information asymmetry be- tween superiors and subordinates. When participation, budget emphasis, and information asymmetry are high (low), slack will be high (low).},

We provide a brief overview of the literature, describe a Bayesian specification of SEMs, and outline a Gibbs sampling strategy for model fitting. Bayesian inferences are illustrated through an industrialization and democratization case study from the literature. The Bayesian approach has some distinct advantages, due to the availability of samples from the joint posterior distribution of the model parameters and latent variables, that we highlight. These posterior samples provide important information not contained in the measurement and structural parameters. As is illustrated using the case study, this information can often provide valuable insight into structural relationships. 1},

Using a novel dataset on manufacturing firms and two organizational configurations derived from extant (mostly qualitative) research examining the influence of strategy on control, we demonstrate fsQCA's superiority over traditional quantitative methods for examining relations that are (1) complex in the sense that they involve higher-order interactions; (2) equifinal in the sense that the same outcome can be achieved through different organizational configurations; and (3) asymmetric in the sense that organizational configurations that explain the presence of the outcome are irrelevant for explaining the absence of the outcome. Moreover, we demonstrate how fsQCA can be combined with traditional quantitative methods to produce complementary findings and address problems that are common to empirical research. Overall, our findings demonstrate the usefulness of set-theoretic methods, such as fsQCA, to accounting research.}

Anticipating and addressing such issues can help accounting researchers, especially doctoral students and junior faculty members, convert an initial empirical accounting research idea into a thoughtful and carefully designed study. Doing this also allows outside readers to provide more beneficial feedback rather than commenting on the common issues that could have been dealt with in advance. The list, provided in the Appendix, consists of five sections: Research Question; Theory; Contribution; Research Design and Analysis; and Interpretation of Results and Conclusions. In each section, we include critical items that readers, journal referees, and seminar participants are likely to raise and offer suggestions for how to address them. The text elaborates on some of the more challenging items, such as how to increase a study's contribution, and provides examples of how such issues have been effectively addressed in previous accounting studies.},

Overall, the effect of control on the principals payoff is nonmonotonic.

In a state with average partisan polarization, the elasticity of election-year investment to a specific measure of policy uncertainty is -0.027. When the incumbent governor is term limited, there is greater uncertainty over the outcome, providing an instrument to demonstrate this effect is causal, not simply coincidental. Moreover, manufacturing investment does not rebound following the election. Rather, own-state uncertainty is associated with a large and significant coincident rise in neighboring states' investment. These findings suggest that policy uncertainty at the subnational level drives investment to alternate sites. (JEL D25, D72, E22, G31, L60, R11)},

As a control we compare the behavior of CEOs with the behavior of students. We find that CEOs are considerably more trusting and exhibit more trustworthiness than students-thus reaching substantially higher efficiency levels than students. Moreover, we find that, for CEOs as well as for students, incentives based on explicit threats to penalize shirking backfire by inducing less trustworthy behavior-giving rise to hidden costs of incentives. However, the availability of penalizing incentives also creates hidden returns: if a principal expresses trust by voluntarily refraining from implementing the punishment threat, the agent exhibits significantly more trustworthiness than if the punishment threat is not available. Thus trust seems to reinforce trustworthy behavior. Overall, trustworthiness is highest if the threat to punish is available but not used, while it is lowest if the threat to punish is used. Paradoxically, however, most CEOs and students use the punishment threat, although CEOs use it significantly less. CR - Copyright \&\#169; 2004 Wiley},

The authors extended this research by studying another type of verbal response that is often used to respond to trust violations but has not been considered in the trust literature: reticence. An accused party may use reticence in a sincere and even legitimate attempt to persuade a trustor to withhold judgment. Yet, by considering information diagnosticity and belief formation mechanisms through which verbal responses influence trust, the authors argue that reticence is a suboptimal response because it combines the least effective elements of apology and denial. Specifically, reticence is a suboptimal response to an integrity violation because, like apology, it fails to address guilt. And reticence is a suboptimal response to a competence violation because, like denial, it fails to signal redemption. Results from 2 laboratory studies, simulating different contexts and using research participants from 2 different countries, provide support for the prediction. The results offer important implications for those who might use reticence to respond to a perceived trust violation and also for those who must judge another's reticence.},

  abstract = {Budgets are typically set through a negotiation process that is repeated in successive periods, often between the same superior and subordinate. Despite this, little is known about budget negotiations in multi-period settings. Temporal interdependence is a fundamental aspect of budget negotiations in multi-period settings, and it refers to the fact that in multi-period budget settings, superiors' (subordinates') decisions and actions in one period can be influenced by subordinates' (superiors') decisions and actions in earlier periods and, in turn, can influence subordinates' (superiors') decisions and actions in later periods. We report the results of an experiment that addresses two issues related to temporal interdependence. The first issue we examine is the effect of an expectation of future budget negotiations with the same individual on current period negotiation strategies and outcomes. Consistent with our expectations, our results indicate that superiors and subordinates who expect future budget negotiations act more cooperatively. For example, when superiors and subordinates expect future budget negotiations, they are more likely to reach agreement on a budget and subordinate performance is higher. The second issue focuses on a multi-period setting with repeated budget negotiations between the same individuals. We examine the pattern of negotiation outcomes across periods to assess the effect of prior budget outcomes on current period negotiation strategies and outcomes. Our results indicate that in this setting, superiors and subordinates react to negotiation strategies and outcomes from prior periods in predictable ways. For example, once a particular superior and subordinate reached agreement, they were more likely to continue to reach agreement in future periods. In addition, superiors' initial negotiation positions across periods and the budget levels across periods were consistent with superiors using subordinate performance in the prior period to update their beliefs about subordinate performance capability. One implication of our results is that some issues identified in prior, single-period budgeting research do not generalize to the multi-period setting where there is temporal interdependence. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Instead, a company's stock can now be traded on up to sixty competing venues where a computer matches incoming orders. A majority of quotes are now posted by high-frequency traders (HFTs), making them the preponderant source of liquidity in the new market. Many practices associated with the new stock market are highly controversial, as illustrated by the public furor following the publication of Michael Lewis's book Flash Boys. Critics say that HFTs use their speed in discovering changes in the market and in altering their orders to take advantage of other traders. Dark pools \textendash{} off-exchange trading venues that promise to keep the orders sent to them secret and to restrict the parties allowed to trade \textendash{} are accused of operating in ways that injure many traders. Brokers are said to mishandle customer orders in an effort to maximize the payments they receive in return for sending trading venues their customers' orders, rather than delivering best execution. In this paper, we set out a simple, but powerful, conceptual framework for analyzing the new stock market. The framework is built upon three basic concepts: adverse selection, the principal-agent problem, and a multi-venue trading system. We illustrate the utility of this framework by analyzing the new market's eight most controversial practices. The effects of each practice are evaluated in terms of the multiple social goals served by equity trading markets. We ultimately conclude that there is no emergency requiring immediate, poorly-considered action. Some reforms proposed by critics, however, are clearly desirable. Other proposed reforms involve a tradeoff between two or more valuable social goals. In these cases, whether a reform is desirable may be unclear, but a better understanding of the tradeoff involved enables a more informed choice and suggests where further empirical research would be useful. Finally, still other proposed reforms are based on misunderstandings of the market or of the social impacts of a practice and should be avoided.},

It is unclear whether the results reveal discrete function by the tongue or combined abilities of the tongue and jaw. One way to isolate the movement of the tongue is to constrain the jaw kinematically by using a bite block. In this study, 10 neurologically normal young adults performed tongue strength and endurance tasks without a bite block ("jaw-free") and with bite blocks of various heights (2, 5, 10, and 15 mm for strength; 5 mm for endurance). Data signals included tongue pressure exerted on an air-filled bulb, surface electromyography (SEMG) from the superior tongue blade, and SEMG from 1 masseter. On average, tongue strength (pressure in kPa) was greatest with no bite block and generally decreased as bite blocks increased in height. Pairwise analyses revealed statistically significant differences for all but 3 comparisons (jaw-free to 2 mm, 2 to 5 mm, and 5 to 10 mm). After removing outlying data from 1 participant, tongue endurance at 50\% of tongue strength was significantly greater without a bite block than with one. SEMG data did not differ significantly for the strength task across bite block conditions, but inspection of the individual data revealed a tendency for masseter activity to be lower when the jaw was unconstrained. These results suggest that maximal tongue strength and endurance are best assessed with an unconstrained mandible or with a very small bite block. MESH Subject(s) below:},

The study also shows that the techniques differ significantly in terms of how interaction effects between context and management accounting are modeled. This implies that some methods are only appropriate when theory predicts interaction effects in general while others are only appropriate in cases where theory specifies a more precise functional form of interaction such as symmetrical or crossover interactions. Based on these observations, several recommendations for future research are proposed. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

The current research experimentally investigates the impact of complementarity of sourcing (internal versus external) and compensation structure (based on division or firm profit) on transfer pricing in the case when such prices are negotiated between the trading divisions. The dependent variables were perceived fairness of the transfer pricing policy, inter-divisional conflict, the economic outcome measure of firm profit, and the time taken by the managers to negotiate an agreement (since time is an important economic resource to the manager) and firm profit efficiency. Overall, the results indicate that whether or not the arrangement of the organizational factors was complementary had a considerable influence on negotiated transfer prices. Specifically, complementary arrangements significantly increased perception of fairness, and reduced both conflict between the trading divisions and the time taken to reach an agreement. However, the economic outcome of firm profit was explained more by the negotiators' competitve behavior which occurs as a consequence of organizational factor arrangements.},

Two different transfer pricing mechanisms are examined: a direct approach where the transfer price and quantity was negotiated between the divisional managers, and an indirect approach in which the divisions communicated their private information to the central headquarters which determined the transfer price and quantity. The objectives were to evaluate the two mechanisms with respect to their effects on firm profit, and the level of conflict between the two divisional managers. A total of 82 subjects, forming 41 dyads, participated in the experiment. The task for a subject was to role play as the manager of either the selling division or the buying division and to determine the number of motors to be transferred or acquired and the corresponding price using one of the two mechanisms. The results indicate a significant difference in firm profit depending on the mechanism achieving higher firm profit than the indirect mechanism. The results also demonstrate that inter-divisional conflict is significantly less under the direct approach than it is under the indirect approach.. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {The controllability principle, which stipulates that managers should only be evaluated based on elements that they can control, has been widely studied in the management control literature, both from theoretical and empirical perspectives. It is based on the idea that the principle leads to better satisfaction of the managers through the neutralization of uncontrollable items in their performance assessment, because it brings fairness in the evaluation. The paper focuses on the managers' opinions concerning the relevancy of these neutralization processes, as regard three types of uncontrollable factors. It develops a conceptual framework to support hypotheses that managers wish the principle to be applied and conducts a survey of 265 French managers. Both quantitative and qualitative results show a significant difference according to whether uncontrollable factors are external to the company or internal (interdependencies and hierarchical decisions), offering new insight as concerns the rationale for the controllability principle. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We present the result of a field study in a group of day-care centers that contradicts this prediction. Parents used to arrive late to collect their children, forcing a teacher to stay after closing time. We introduced a monetary fine for late-coming parents. As a result, the number of late-coming parents increased significantly. After the fine was removed no reduction occurred. We argue that penalties are usually introduced into an incomplete contract, social or private. They may change the information that agents have, and therefore the effect on behavior may be opposite of that expected. If this is true, the deterrence hypothesis loses its predictive strength, since the clause ``everything else is left unchanged'' might be hard to satisfy.},

The purpose of our study is to clarify a number of issues, so as to guide future research in this area. We do not claim to have all the answers. Rather we make a number of assumptions explicit to show when it is important to address multiple MC practices simultaneously, why this is the case, and what the empirical implications are. Our research directly relates to the systems approach to contingency theory and the literature's struggle to clearly define its most fundamental concept, i.e., "internal consistency". Our analysis provides a formal definition of "internal consistency" and shows how it can be used to conceptualize MC systems, thereby giving contingency theorists the necessary ingredient to move forward. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Organizations that rely heavily on employee creativity face a dilemma: the particular nature of creative production calls for a substantial use of formal control, yet such control can undermine employee creativity. We examine this dilemma by analyzing how an organization's reliance on creativity influences its choice of control practices. More specifically, we argue that an organization's high reliance on employee creativity generates two types of cost, which will be reflected in the control choices made by its top management. First, a high reliance on employee creativity brings with it particular risks of dysfunctional employee behavior such as an overly narrow focus on the individual task or the opportunistic use of task-specific expertise. Second, it generates costs when it induces organizations to abstain from the use of (otherwise effective) controls because such controls increase the risk of undermining employee creativity. We identify two characteristics of the work setting - the importance of employees' intrinsic task motivation and the lack of task-specific cause-effect knowledge on part of managers - which help us to better understand the sources of the cost of creativity. Using survey data from 457 companies, we provide evidence that the importance managers attach to their employees' intrinsic task motivation is associated with a higher emphasis on assessments of non-task related performance, while a perceived lack of task-specific cause-effect knowledge on the managers' side is associated with more use of predefined targets for performance evaluation. Both work characteristics contribute to explaining higher emphasis on employee selection processes and increased delegation in work settings that heavily rely on employee creativity.},

We find that CEOs are least likely to share or delegate decision-making authority in mergers and acquisitions, relative to delegation of capital structure, payout, investment, and capital allocation decisions. We also find that CEOs are more likely to delegate decision authority when the firm is large or complex. Delegation is less likely when the CEO is particularly knowledgeable about a project, when the CEO has an MBA degree or long tenure, and when the CEO's pay is tilted towards incentive compensation. We study capital allocation in detail and learn that most companies allocate funds across divisions using the net present value rule, the reputation of the divisional manager, the timing of a project's cash flows, and senior management's "gut feel." Corporate politics and corporate socialism are more important allocation criteria in foreign countries than in the U.S.},

Grossman sought to detail the many subtle factors infusing Freudian theory, from its initial sources to its consolidation as a system, to its embrace in the mind of an analyst who will use it, and on to the many iterations of its progress on the way to being applied in the clinical situation. This progression assumes a recognition of the analyst's need to be at once both experiencer and observer. Implicit in the attempt to understand another is a self-reflective taking of oneself as an object of analysis. How an essential tension is worked out between the subjective and objective points of view is an issue that pervades Grossman's writings. This is but one instance of a larger tendency characterizing his ideas-thinking psychoanalytically about psychoanalysis itself. Factors he implicated in being a contemporary Freudian analyst are then taken up.},

In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Unobservability of returns increases the principal's ability to appropriate the returns but reduces her ability to improve incentives. The optimal information structure depends on bargaining power.},

We propose that a manager's reporting decisions are affected by his or her trade-off of the bene- fits of appearing honest against the benefits of misrepresentation. The information system affects the manager's trade-off by improving the owner's ability to make an inference regarding the manager's level of honesty. Thus, to the extent that the manager perceives benefits to appearing honest, the presence of an information system can increase managerial honesty. As the information system becomes more precise, however, the manager must forgo greater benefits of misrepresentation in order to achieve the same appearance of hon- esty. For managers under a precise system, this will shift the trade-off decision toward the benefits of misrepresentation and away from the benefits of appearing honest. Notably, in our experiment, the only benefit of appearing honest is an intrinsically motivated desire for social approval. We find that, although the existence of an information system increases managerial honesty, honesty is lower under a precise than under a coarse information sys- tem. We also compare profit earned by the owners in our experiment, which relies on a behavioral role of an information system, with the maximum profit theoretically possible given a contractual use of the information system. This comparison suggests that, unless the available information system is sufficiently precise, the owner will obtain greater profits by not contracting on its output, even if that output is fully contractible.},

  abstract = {This study investigates experimentally how mutual monitoring affects effort when employees are compensated via rank-order tournaments. Theory and anecdotal evidence suggest that mutual monitoring may either decrease effort by facilitating collusion or increase effort by stimulating competition. In our first experiment, we find that mutual monitoring increases effort, because participants do not attempt to collude but rather behave competitively. This result leads us to expand our theory and develop hypotheses to predict that the effect of mutual monitoring depends on whether employees have the inclination to collude or compete. Specifically, we predict that mutual monitoring decreases effort when employees are inclined to collude and increases effort when employees are inclined to compete; that is, mutual monitoring will not change the basic inclination created by the workplace setting, but will 'turn up the volume' on the effect that such inclination has on effort. Consistent with our predictions, our second experiment finds that mutual monitoring leads to lower effort when participants have a collusive inclination and (eventually) higher effort when they have a competitive inclination. Overall, the results from these two experiments suggest that allowing employees to observe each other's productive effort in tournament incentive settings may have positive or negative consequences for the firm, depending on whether environmental factors predispose employees to collude or compete.

We focus on the change in conservatism of private firms following initial issuance of public debt and examine the effects of agency conflicts between bondholders and shareholders on the change in conservatism. Regression analyses on a large sample of public bond issues by Korean private firms reveal the following. First, private firms with public debt exhibit a higher degree of conservatism than those with exclusively private debt. The incremental effect of public debt on the level of conservatism is virtually equivalent in magnitude to that of public equity. Second, and more importantly, private firms that issue public debt for the first time show a significant increase in conservatism, whereas corresponding public firms do not. Third, private firms with high agency costs of public debt (characterized by high information asymmetry and high credit risk) undergo a greater increase in conservatism following their initial bond issues than those with low agency costs. Further analysis shows that private firms sustain increased levels of conservatism even beyond the time period of average maturity of initial bonds, and that bond investors reward this long-term commitment to conservative accounting by gradually reducing interest rates for seasoned bond issuers. The findings of this study shed light on how information demand arising from public debt issuance, especially by private firms with high ex ante agency costs, engenders conservative financial reporting in emerging markets.},

We use a structural equation model to investigate whether the extent a firm emphasizes a flexible culture is related to the emphasis placed on beliefs, boundary, diagnostic and interactive controls. We also examine whether a key contingency variable, size, moderates our proposed model. Using survey data from 267 top managers of medium-sized firms, we find, as expected, that the more firms emphasize a flexible culture, the more they emphasize the use of beliefs controls. We show that this finding is robust to firm size. Thus, we conclude that the emphasis placed on beliefs control is an important control mechanism in organizations that emphasize a flexible culture. We also conclude that size moderates the associations among the control levers. Relative to the subsample of smaller firms, in the subsample of larger firms the beliefs and boundary control uses of performance measures are more reinforcing of each other while the diagnostic use of performance measures and boundary control act more as replacements for each other.},

We generate benchmarks against which empirically observed earnings-returns relations and aggregate earnings distributions can be evaluated. This parsimonious model shows a coherent set of results: reported losses are less persistent than reported gains, decision making diminishes the S-shaped market response to earnings and earnings relate to returns asymmetrically in the way documented by Basu [1997]. Furthermore, the implied frequency distribution of aggregate earnings is neither symmetric nor necessarily single-peaked. Instead, it may exhibit a kink at zero and look similar to the plots reported by Burgstahler and Dichev [1997]. However, within our model, none of these phenomena are due to reporting noise, bias, or some undesirable strategic managerial behavior. They are the natural consequences of using past earnings as the basis for value increasing managerial decision making that in turn generates the future earnings on which future decisions will be based.},

The optimal contract is a binary payment scheme even for a rich performance measure, where standard preferences predict a fully contingent contract. The logic is that, due to the stochastic reference point, increasing the number of different wages reduces the agent's expected utility without providing strong additional incentives. Moreover, for diminutive occurrence probabilities for all signals the agent is rewarded with the fixed bonus if his performance exceeds a certain threshold.},

  abstract = {Researchers have long struggled to identify causal effects in nonexperimental settings. Many recently proposed strategies assume ignorability of the treatment assignment mechanism and require fitting two models-one for the assignment mechanism and one for the response surface. This article proposes a strategy that instead focuses on very flexibly modeling just the response surface using a Bayesian nonparametric modeling procedure, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). BART has several advantages: it is far simpler to use than many recent competitors, requires less guesswork in model fitting, handles a large number of predictors, yields coherent uncertainty intervals, and fluidly handles continuous treatment variables and missing data for the outcome variable. BART also naturally identifies heterogeneous treatment effects. BART produces more accurate estimates of average treatment effects compared to propensity score matching, propensity-weighted estimators, and regression adjustment in the nonlinear simulation situations examined. Further, it is highly competitive in linear settings with the "correct" model, linear regression. Supplemental materials including code and data to replicate simulations and examples from the article as well as methods for population inference are available online.

  abstract = {Standard setters and regulators generally assume that making accounting information easier to process leads to more efficient markets, thereby benefiting traders. I test that assumption in markets that I construct to be more prone to price bubbles. Market efficiency (i.e., trading at expected fundamental economic values) will increase if and only if reduced accounting information complexity leads traders to process that information to a greater extent than more complex information and then to trade in a manner that moves price closer to fundamental value. I test these relationships in an experiment in which traders buy and sell shares of an asset in a multiperiod, double auction market in which speculative capital gains are possible. I find that reducing complexity in information increases information processing ease. This increased information processing increases market efficiency in markets less prone to price bubbles but not in markets more prone to price bubbles. This is because in markets more prone to price bubbles some traders that process information trade in a rational manner that moves price away from expected fundamental value, thereby harming other traders. Thus, the benefits of reducing accounting complexity do not persist in markets prone to bubble. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {Incentives are often associated with narrow financial rewards such as bonuses or executive stock options. But in general such rewards are just a small part of the design of incentives. Properly designed incentive systems have to take into account the full portfolio of activities that the agent can engage in, the array of instruments, many nonfinancial, that are available to influence individuals and consider the factors that motivate them in different settings. Thinking about incentives as a system of interacting instruments and influences has been a major advance in the economics of incentives in recent years. In this lecture I will describe the path from pay for performance to the broader view of incentive systems. (JEL D21, D82, D86, J33, J41, M12, M52)},

To this end, we present a sample of econometric models that have been used in a variety of recent applications where parameters of interest are partially identified, highlighting common features and themes across these papers. In addition, in order to help illustrate the combined roles of data and assumptions, we present numerical illustrations for a particular application, the joint determination of wages and labor supply. Finally we discuss the benefits and challenges of using partially identifying models in empirical work and point to possible avenues of future research.},

Although analysts are commonly viewed as industry specialists, we fail to find evidence that analysts have an information advantage over managers at the industry level.

We find that firms rely less on financial measures (and more on nonfinancial measures or subjective evaluations) in determining local managers' bonuses when those managers have greater influence over the design of internal accounting systems. At the same time, we find no significant association between the choice of performance measures and local managers' authority to make operating decisions. Instead, we find that local authority to make operating decisions is positively associated with local managers' influence over accounting systems. Taken together, our findings suggest that the design of internal accounting systems is an important dimension of overall organizational design. Our findings also cast doubt on the maintained assumption in prior work that major organizational design choices are complementary.

Results using a cross-sectional sample of manufacturing plants indicates that extensive ABC use is associated with higher quality levels and greater improvements in cycle time and quality, and is indirectly associated with manufacturing cost reductions through quality and cycle time improvements. However, on average, extensive ABC use has no significant association with return on assets. Instead, we find weak evidence that the association between ABC and accounting profitability is contingent on the plant's operational characteristics.},

Since PIT reduce consumption and increase cost of labor, investment decisions can be affected because of the inevitable link of production input factors. Using data on PIT in 27 European countries and three within-country approaches, we find that personal income taxes substantially reduce investment. The magnitude is comparable to the effect of corporate taxes. We also document that the PIT-investment relationship can be explained by increased labor costs and by reduced consumption due to higher PIT.},

Our results also indicate that competition and tight control are complements: The positive effect of competition is enhanced by the presence of a strong ultimate owner.},

Empirical research on the levers of control (LOC) framework is used as an example. In LOC research, a path model approach to interdependence has been developed. The appropriateness of this approach is evaluated, developed, and compared with the correlation of residuals approach (seemingly unrelated regression) implemented in the wider complementarity literature. Empirical examples of the different models are shown and compared by using a data set on LOC of 120 SBUs in Sweden. The empirical results show that modeling interdependence among control practices in a management control system as non-recursive (bi-directional) paths or as residual correlations evidently affects the conclusions drawn about interdependence in terms of both presence and magnitude. The two models imply different views on how to conceptualize interdependence and are not statistically and empirically comparable. If using non-recursive path models, several model specification issues appear. To be able to identify such models, this needs to be carefully considered in the theory and research design prior to data collection.},

Information sharing followed from initial trust expectations, and information sharing did not fully mediate the relationship between expectations and climate of trust. Negotiating effectiveness was associated with the quantity of information shared but not with trust. Procedural inefficiency (time to discover the solution) decreased as information quantity increased, but procedural inefficiency was not related to trust. One measure of outcome inefficiency (complexity of the agreement) decreased as trust increased, but another measure of outcome inefficiency (monetary cost of the agreement) was not related to trust. Unexpectedly, buyers' monetary cost increased as information increased, suggesting that sellers might profit from information exchange and, indirectly, from trust. Contributions and limitations of the study are discussed in addition to implications of trust in negotiations by practicing managers.},

Strategy can be formally interpreted as an idealized path optimizing heterogeneous resource deployment to produce maximum financial gain.

The business model that underpins strategy may be seen as a set of constraints on resources that can be interpreted as controls in optimal control theory. Strategy then might be considered to be the control variable of firm path, suggesting in turn that the firm's business model is the codification of the application of investment resources used to control the strategic path of value realization.

Using an experiment in which participants design "rebus puzzles," this study tests whether the incremental benefits of contract self-selection extend to a multidimensional performance environment in which participants choose between a contract that rewards both quantity and creativity versus a contract that rewards quantity only. Findings indicate that participants who choose a creativity-weighted pay scheme perceive themselves to have greater creative potential than those who choose a quantity-only scheme. This perceived creativity advantage manifests itself in the superior initial creativity ratings of such participants' productive output. However, in the aggregate, participants paid only for quantity eventually surpass the creativity-weighted productivity scores of participants paid for creativity-weighted productivity, whether compensation contracts are self-selected or randomly assigned. Thus, the implications of contract selection on creativity-weighted productivity hinge on the importance of the initial advantage enjoyed by participants who self-select a creativity-weighted contract.

When we replicate this structure multiple times under both fixed pay and pay tied to performance, our findings do not support Jamal and Sunder's (1991) conclusion about the incremental effects of performance-based compensation, suggesting that other features varied in that study likely account for their observed difference. Our ceteris paribus replication leaves us unable to offer any generalized conclusions about the effects of monetary incentives in other market structures, but the broader point is to illustrate that experimental designs that attempt to generalize effects by varying multiple features simultaneously can jeopardize the ability to draw causal inferences about the primary treatment manipulation.},

In an experiment in which participants design ``rebus puzzles,'' we find that combining quan- tity and creativity measures in a creativity-weighted pay scheme results in creativity-weighted productivity scores that are significantly lower than those generated by participants with quantity incentives alone. Follow-up analysis indicates that relative to participants in the quantity-only condition, partic- ipants in the creativity-weighted condition produce approximately the same numberof high-creativity puzzles, but produce significantly fewer puzzles over- all. Thus, while participants rewarded for creativity-weighted output tend to restrict their production to high-creativity efforts, they are unable to translate this focus into a greater volume of high-creativity output. Implications address a possible explanation for firms' reluctance to incorporate creativity measures within multidimensional performance measurement systems, notwithstand- ing published suggestions to do so.},

Findings indicate that expectations of fairness-based price conces- sions do not survive actual negotiations when participants negotiate over a computer network with no communication other than bids, asks, and accep- tances. Conversely, both expectations and actual negotiated outcomes reflect fairness-based price concessions when participants negotiate in a face-to- face setting with unrestricted communication. Together, these results imply that the extent to which questionnaire-based judgments of social behavior generalize to actual behavior depends on the whether the competitive envi- ronment suppresses or reinforces the social presence necessary to sustain phenomena such as preferences for fairness.},

I review the empirical evidence on these two sets of anomalies. Paying for inherently interesting tasks, paying for prosocial behavior, paying too much, paying too little, and providing too many options can all be counterproductive. At the same time, proper design of the decision-making environment can be a potent way to induce cer- tain behaviors. After presenting the empirical evidence, I discuss the relative role of beliefs, preferences, and technology in the anomalous impacts of incentives. I argue that inference, signaling, loss aversion, dynamic inconsistency, and choking are the primary factors that explain the data.},

  abstract = {In the classroom, activity-based costing (ABC) looks like a great way to manage a company's limited resources. But executives who have tried to implement ABC in their organizations on any significant scale have often abandoned the attempt in the face of rising costs and employee irritation. They should try again, because a new approach sidesteps the difficulties associated with large-scale ABC implementation. In the revised model, managers estimate the resource demands imposed by each transaction, product, or customer, rather than relying on time-consuming and costly employee surveys. This method is simpler since it requires, for each group of resources, estimates of only two parameters: how much it costs per time unit to supply resources to the business's activities (the total overhead expenditure of a department divided by the total number of minutes of employee time available) and how much time it takes to carry out one unit of each kind of activity (as estimated or observed by the manager). This approach also overcomes a serious technical problem associated with employee surveys: the fact that, when asked to estimate time spent on activities, employees invariably report percentages that add up to 100. Under the new system, managers take into account time that is idle or unused. Armed with the data, managers then construct time equations, a new feature that enables the model to reflect the complexity of real-world operations by showing how specific order, customer, and activity characteristics cause processing times to vary. This Tool Kit uses concrete examples to demonstrate how managers can obtain meaningful cost and profitability information, quickly and inexpensively. Rather than endlessly updating and maintaining ABC data,they can now spend their time addressing the deficiencies the model reveals: inefficient processes, unprofitable products and customers, and excess capacity.},

Supplementary analyses also revealed that the interactive effects of violation type and violation response on participants' trusting intentions were mediated by their trusting beliefs.

We show that there always exists a separating equilibrium in which workers self-select into firms that differ in their monetary incentives as well as their level of worker cooperation.

  abstract = {Running studies with high statistical power, while effect size estimates in psychology are often inaccurate, leads to a practical challenge when designing an experiment. This challenge can be addressed by performing sequential analyses while the data collection is still in progress. At an interim analysis, data collection can be stopped whenever the results are convincing enough to conclude that an effect is present, more data can be collected, or the study can be terminated whenever it is extremely unlikely that the predicted effect will be observed if data collection would be continued. Such interim analyses can be performed while controlling the Type 1 error rate. Sequential analyses can greatly improve the efficiency with which data are collected. Additional flexibility is provided by adaptive designs where sample sizes are increased on the basis of the observed effect size. The need for pre-registration, ways to prevent experimenter bias, and a comparison between Bayesian approaches and null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) are discussed. Sequential analyses, which are widely used in large-scale medical trials, provide an efficient way to perform high-powered informative experiments. I hope this introduction will provide a practical primer that allows researchers to incorporate sequential analyses in their research. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

A survey of 75 recent accounting articles in leading journals reveals that many researchers implement the technique in a mechanical way with relatively little appreciation of important econometric issues and problems surrounding its use. Using empirical examples motivated by prior research, we illustrate that selection models are fragile and can yield quite literally any possible outcome in response to fairly minor changes in model specification. We conclude with guidance on how researchers can better implement selection models that will provide more convincing evidence on potential selection bias, including the need to justify model specifications and careful sensitivity analyses with respect to robustness and multicollinearity.

  abstract = {Literature on safety climate suggests that work-related accidents are prevented in an environment that both adheres to safety regulations and responds constructively to errors. Research has yet to clarify however how leaders combine the seemingly paradoxical aspects of enforcing safety regulations while allowing room for mistakes against safety regulations. We use theory and research on behavioral integrity to hypothesize that when leaders are perceived to live up to espoused safety values, teams are more likely to place a higher priority on safety regulations and feel more psychologically safe to speak up and admit mistakes. Results from survey data of 580 nurses and 54 teams showed that head nurse behavioral integrity for safety positively relates to team priority of safety and team psychological safety. In turn, team priority of safety and psychological safety were found to be respectively negatively and positively related with the number of treatment errors reported to head nurses. We further demonstrated an interaction effect between team priority of safety and team psychological safety on reported errors such that the relationship between team priority of safety and the number of errors was stronger for higher levels of team psychological safety. Finally we showed that team priority of safety, psychological safety, and their interaction mediated the relation between behavioral integrity for safety and reported treatment errors. We discuss how these results offer more insight into how behavioral integrity helps solve the managerial dilemma of providing clear direction while allowing room for employee learning. Keywords: Behavioral integrity, priority of safety, psychological safety, treatment errors, safety climate, leadership.}

For each decision process we identify families of related psychology models that have supported robust theory-consistent empirical results. ThisMAliterature addresses four main themes. First, individuals subjective valuation of monetary payoffs often depends on frames (reference points) provided by MA, and frames can influence the use ofMAinformation in decision making. Sec- ond, the subjective value of non-monetary (social) payoffs from sources such as fairness, honesty, reciprocity, social identity or affect influence and are influenced by individuals MA-related decisions. Third, indi- viduals subjective models of MA-related decisions often incorporate predictable simplifications that influence and are influenced by MA. Fourth, MA can influence sometimes bias or limit individuals' learning, and learning influences MA, as individuals acquire parameter and variable values or the information to estimate them subjectively. We also identify two emerging themes and three gaps in the psychology- based MA literature.},

Specifically, we examine the willingness of managers to obtain additional, costly information that would supplement this measure and allow the managers to more accurately assess individual contributions to team output. Using theory from behavioral economics that incorporates social preferences (i.e., fairness and trust reciprocity) into the managers' utility function, we predict and demonstrate experimentally that managers' willingness to obtain the costly information increases as the team's aggregate performance becomes a more noisy measure of individual performance. Further, we predict and demonstrate that managers' willingness will be greater for relatively high versus relatively low levels of aggregate performance. The study contributes to the literature on subjective performance evaluation by identifying how social preferences influence managers' use of discretion in evaluation processes.

Moreover, discrimination against an individual implies lower pay and performance, suggesting that the extent of discrimination as measured after controlling for performance may underestimate the level of true discrimination. Finally, the optimal contract entails the use of bonus pay rather than the threat of dismissal, hence neither ``efficiency wages'' nor the right to dismiss an employee are necessary ingredients for an optimal incentive contract.},

Contracts that provide a bonus to the seller if the quality is acceptable or impose a penalty on the seller if quality is unacceptable can, in theory, provide efficient incentives. But how are such contracts enforced? While the courts can be used, doing so involves high real costs. Informal enforcement, involving a loss of reputation and future access to the market for any party that defaults on a contract, may often be a better alternative. This paper explores the use of both formal and informal enforcement mechanisms, provides a rationale for a variety of observed market mechanisms, and then generates a number of testable hypotheses.},

Although the prior distribution should ideally encode the users' prior knowledge about the parameters, this level of knowledge transfer seems to be unattainable in practice and applied statisticians are forced to search for a "default" prior. Despite the development of objective priors, which are only available explicitly for a small number of highly restricted model classes, the applied statistician has few practical guidelines to follow when choosing the priors. An easy way out of this dilemma is to re-use prior choices of others, with an appropriate reference. In this paper, we introduce a new concept for constructing prior distributions. We exploit the natural nested structure inherent to many model components, which defines the model component to be a flexible extension of a base model. Proper priors are defined to penalise the complexity induced by deviating from the simpler base model and are formulated after the input of a user-defined scaling parameter for that model component. These priors are invariant to reparameterisations, have a natural connection to Jeffreys' priors, are designed to support Occam's razor and seem to have excellent robustness properties, all which are highly desirable and allow us to use this approach to define default prior distributions.},

Specifically, we experimentally investigate the benefits of activity-based costing (ABC) information to address common supply-chain inefficiencies that are caused by the buyer or the seller, but have the same underlying costs. Results suggest that the impact of more precise cost information depends crucially on the cause of the inefficiency that parties need to address during the negotiation. ABC information increases the total joint profit in the supply chain. However, ABC information increases the seller's perceptions of the fairness of the buyer's arguments for contract changes only when the buyer causes the inefficiency but not when the seller causes the inefficiency. The combined effect of ABC information on joint profit and fairness perceptions thus increases the buyer's profit only when buyer causes the inefficiency but not when the seller causes the inefficiency.Data Availability: Data are available from the first author upon request.},

We present an analytical model showing that managerial allocation of effort is a function of not only relative incentive weights but also the difficulty of performance targets. We find that relative incentive weights and target difficulty can either be complements or substitutes in motivating effort depending on the extent to which managers have alternative employment opportunities. To test the predictions of our model, we use survey data on performance targets in annual bonus plans. Our sample of 877 survey respondents consists primarily of financial executives in small- and medium-size private companies where annual bonuses are important both for motivation and retention. Consistent with our model, we find that relative incentive weights are negatively (positively) associated with perceived target difficulty when concerns about managerial retention are high (low). It follows that performance measures included in annual bonus plans have sometimes easy and other times challenging targets depending on their relative incentive weights and retention concerns.},

I apply this framework to aggregate the evidence from 7 randomised experiments of expanding access to microcredit, to assess both the general impact of the intervention and the heterogeneity across contexts. The evidence suggests that the general impact of microcredit access on household profits is likely to be small, with an effect of zero well within the 95\% posterior credible interval in all specifications. Standard pooling metrics for the studies indicate 49-81\% pooling on the treatment effects, suggesting that the site-specific effects are reasonably informative and externally valid for each other and for the general case. Further analysis incorporating household covariates shows that the cross-study heterogeneity is almost entirely generated by heterogeneous effects for the 27\% households who previously operated businesses before microcredit expansion. A cautious assessment of the correlations between site-specific covariates and treatment effects using a Bayesian Ridge procedure indicates that the interest rate on the microloans has the strongest correlation with the treatment effects.}

This finding contrasts with the prescription made in most management accounting textbooks suggesting that for optimum motivation budget targets should be achievable less than 50 percent of the time. Managers maintain, however, that these highly achievable targets provide considerable challenge, and the high achievability actually provides many advantages, including improved corporate reporting, resource planning, control, and, combined with other control system elements, even motivation.

The empirical results show that, if financial performance measures are ''good'' (''poor'') incentive measures, i.e., high (low) on sensitivity, precision, and verifiability, then using these measures for in-centive purposes increases (decreases) delegation.

Prior studies have primarily focused on students' capacity for multitasking and distraction when using laptops. The present research suggests that even when laptops are used solely to take notes, they may still be impairing learning because their use results in shallower processing. In three studies, we found that students who took notes on laptops performed worse on conceptual questions than students who took notes longhand. We show that whereas taking more notes can be beneficial, laptop note takers' tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning.},

This view shapes our understanding of many crucial elements of development economics-from how rural villagers save, to how parents decide on whether to send their children to school. Psychological research, however, has documented the incompleteness of this perspective. Individuals have self-control and time inconsistency problems. They can give into short- run temptations and later regret it. They can have strong feelings about others that drive them to commit both generous and spiteful acts. They often passively accept defaults rather than make active choices. They let the institutions around them make choices for them. And they may misread new data in a ways that fit their beliefs. In short, the rational maximization model may not be a very good approximation of human behavior. In this paper, I present some of the psychological evidence that I believe helps us to better understand a few core issues in development economics, such as savings, education, and property rights. This gives us new ways to interpret a variety of behaviors in these contexts, and enriches the set of policy tools we should consider. This evidence also suggests not only the need for dramatically new tools, but suggests small cost changes that may dramatically improve their efficacy of existing policies.},

Here we study instances of the knapsack problem, a discrete optimisation problem commonly encountered at all levels of cognition, from attention gating to intellectual discovery. Complexity of this problem is well understood from the perspective of a mechanical device like a computer. We show experimentally that human performance too decreased with complexity as defined in computer science. Defying traditional economic principles, participants spent effort way beyond the point where marginal gain was positive, and economic performance increased with instance difficulty. Human attempts at solving the instances exhibited commonalities with algorithms developed for computers, although biological resource constraints\textendash limited working and episodic memories\textendash had noticeable impact. Consistent with the very nature of the knapsack problem, only a minority of participants found the solution\textendash often quickly\textendash but the ones who did appeared not to realise. Substantial heterogeneity emerged, suggesting why prizes and patents, schemes that incentivise intellectual discovery but discourage information sharing, have been found to be less effective than mechanisms that reveal private information, such as markets.},

If resources are endogenously selected, regression based methods that examine their connection to firm performance will be mis-estimated. We show that traditional remedies for endogeneity do not resolve this problem when returns to resources are heterogeneous (as theorized under RBV) and when managers act with at least partial knowledge of the expected, idiosyncratic return (as theorized under the strategic factor market hypotheses). As such, we develop a Bayesian approach that solves this endogeneity problem by directly incorporating resource picking into the modeling framework. We illustrate the validity of our approach through the use of a comprehensive simulation study and show that our proposed approach outperforms traditional linear models (including traditional cures of endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity) under a variety of conditions. Our findings suggest that: (1) research in strategy requires a more careful and deeper understanding of potential sources of endogeneity and (2) the use of Bayesian methods in management can help develop more theoretically motivated empirical approaches to hypothesis testing.},

  abstract = {Without a doubt, there has been a "credibility revolution" in applied econometrics. One contributing development has been in the improvement and increased use in data analysis of "structural methods"; that is, the use of models based in economic theory. Structural modeling attempts to use data to identify the parameters of an underlying economic model, based on models of individual choice or aggregate relations derived from them. Structural estimation has a long tradition in economics, but better and larger data sets, more powerful computers, improved modeling methods, faster computational techniques, and new econometric methods such as those mentioned above have allowed researchers to make significant improvements. While Angrist and Pischke extol the successes of empirical work that estimates "treatment effects" based on actual or quasi-experiments, they are much less sanguine about structural analysis and hold industrial organization up as an example where "progress is less dramatic." Indeed, reading their article one comes away with the impression that there is only a single way to conduct credible empirical analysis. This seems to us a very narrow and dogmatic approach to empirical work; credible analysis can come in many guises, both structural and nonstructural, and for some questions structural analysis offers important advantages. In this comment, we address the criticism of structural analysis and its use in industrial organization, and consider why empirical analysis in industrial organization differs in such striking ways from that in fields such as labor, which have recently emphasized the methods favored by Angrist and Pischke.},

The stronger these layers, the better the protection against adversity (Pronk et al. in The Resilience Shield, Pan Macmillan Australia, 2021).

Each has a tendency to drift away from dialectical interpretations of loose coupling toward a unidimensional interpretation of loose coupling, thus weakening the explanatory value of the concept. If loose coupling is maintained as a dialectical concept, it can clarify the answers to several organizational puzzles that have eluded organization theorists. These puzzles involve: 1. the definition of organization, 2. the use of loose coupling in the measurement and interpretation of interpretative systems, and 3. the fluidity, complexity, and social construction of organizational structure. The simplification of unidimensionality can be avoided by: 1. not using research methodologies that encourage researchers to parse dialectical concepts into unidimensional variables, 2. seeing systems as an arena for complex, ongoing processes, and 3. ignoring the presence of connectedness within organizations.},

The theory under which this is informative is one in which the selection on observables is proportional to selection on unobservables, an idea which is formalized in Altonji, Elder and Taber (2005). However, this connection is rarely made explicit and the underlying assumption is rarely tested. In this paper I first show how, under proportional selection, coeffcient movements, along with movements in R-squared values, can be used to calculate a measure of omitted variable bias. I then undertake two validation exercises. First, I relate maternal behavior on child birth weight and IQ. Simple controlled regressions give misleading estimates; estimates adjusted with a proportional selection adjustment fit significantly better. Second, I match observational and randomized trial data for 29 relationships in public health. I show that on average bias-adjusted coeffcients perform much better than simple controlled coeffcients and I suggest that a simple form of this adjustment could dramatically improve inference in many public health contexts.}

Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that un- derly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assump- tions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coher- entmathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effects of potential interven- tions, (also called ``causal effects'' or ``policy evaluation'') (2) queries about probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of ``regret,'' ``attri- bution'' or ``causes of effects'') and (3) queries about direct and indirect effects (also known as ``mediation''). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both.},

  abstract = {Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. The book will open the way for including causal analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and economics. Students in these fields will find natural models, simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 5,000 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research. Causality will be of interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating and invaluable.},

In these data sets, the residuals may be correlated across firms or across time, and OLS standard errors can be biased. Historically, the two literatures have used different solutions to this problem. Corporate finance has relied on clustered standard errors, while asset pricing has used the Fama-MacBeth procedure. This paper examines the different methods used in the literature and explains when the different methods yield the same (and correct) standard errors and when they diverge. The intent is to provide intuition as to why the different approaches sometimes give different answers and give researchers guidance for their use.},

We recognize that firms invest in controls to manage collaborative relationships, and argue that these investments generate switching costs, namely, opportunity and reinvestment costs. We collect data on outsourcing transactions by conducting semi-structured interviews across multiple field sites. Observed patterns across 53 cases show that firms with trust-based controls experience the most difficulty in switching suppliers, whereas firms with market-based controls experience the greatest ease. Firms with bureaucratic-based and hybrid controls generally lie between these extremes. Furthermore, in nearly 50 percent of our sample (25 cases), respondents indicate that the switching costs associated with control choices increase the difficulty of switching suppliers. We also find evidence that the magnitude and nature of switching costs vary with the types of controls chosen.

Results indicate that managers' evaluations of the relevance and usefulness of cost data are positively correlated with the extent to which systems can provide greater cost detail, better classify costs according to behavior, and report cost information more frequently. However, only the ability to supply cost detail is favorably associated with measures of financial performance, including operating margin, cash flow, and administrative expense. Interestingly, cost-system design was not associated with operating expense per admission, suggesting that accounting information had not yet been successfully used to manage clinical costs. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to critically review the empirical transfer pricing literature as a means of determining the agenda for future research. Design/methodology/approach: The review is carried out primarily by searching databases, academic journals and books. Second, professional surveys are reviewed to inform the development of research ideas. Findings: The understanding and ability to explain international transfer pricing in practice remain limited despite a rapidly increasing tax regulatory pressure on multinational enterprises. One important explanatory factor is that accounting and tax research has not been integrated to a sufficient extent. As a consequence, rather isolated research streams and knowledge building have taken place, failing to leverage the synergies of a combined research approach. Research limitations/implications: A stronger emphasis on the outcome of specific transfer pricing system designs would improve the literature's current status in terms of whether the objectives aimed at by the system are actually achieved. A new framework and promising research questions are proposed to guide future work on this issue. Practical implications: The proposed framework may serve as guidance for practitioners seeking to assess the performance of specific transfer pricing systems and potentially provide directions for refinement of current system designs when dysfunctional consequences are identified. Originality/value: Previous transfer pricing research has taken a rather isolated approach. This paper is an attempt to guide future transfer pricing research towards an inter-disciplinary approach.},

JAGS is designed to work closely with the R language and environment for statistical computation and graphics (http://www.r-project.org).

Institutionalists believe that behavior depends on the habits, routines and customs of economic actors, which are passed along by example, the expectations of society, social sanctions, and the power of the state. Alternatively, human behavior can be viewed as having survival value, thus moving institutional economics toward evolutionary economics.},

  abstract = {In longitudinal panels and other regression models with unobserved effects, fixed effects estimation is often paired with cluster-robust variance estimation (CRVE) in order to account for heteroskedasticity and un-modeled dependence among the errors. CRVE is asymptotically consistent as the number of independent clusters increases, but can be biased downward for sample sizes often found in applied work, leading to hypothesis tests with overly liberal rejection rates. One solution is to use bias-reduced linearization (BRL), which corrects the CRVE so that it is unbiased under a working model, and t-tests with Satterthwaite degrees of freedom. We propose a generalization of BRL that can be applied in models with arbitrary sets of fixed effects, where the original BRL method is undefined, and describe how to apply the method when the regression is estimated after absorbing the fixed effects. We also propose a small-sample test for multiple-parameter hypotheses, which generalizes the Satterthwaite approximation for t-tests. In simulations covering a variety of study designs, we find that conventional cluster-robust Wald tests can severely under-reject while the proposed small-sample test maintains Type I error very close to nominal levels.},

In particular, we identify vendors of algorithmic pre-employment assessments (i.e., algorithms to screen candidates), document what they have disclosed about their development and validation procedures, and evaluate their practices, focusing particularly on efforts to detect and mitigate bias. Our analysis considers both technical and legal perspectives. Technically, we consider the various choices vendors make regarding data collection and prediction targets, and explore the risks and trade-offs that these choices pose. We also discuss how algorithmic de-biasing techniques interface with, and create challenges for, antidiscrimination law.},

Each subject played the role of a divisional manager. Market threat capacity was the option held by one negotiator to sell or buy his or her product in an external market. Incentives were based either entirely on a division{${'}$}s profit or on both the divisional profits and the firmwide profits. Time horizon was manipulated at two levels-a single round of bargaining or a multiple round setting, the length of which was not specified to the subjects. Uncertainty regarding threat capacity reduced the frequency of cooperative bargaining. Contrary to expectations, subjects paid according to divisional profits cooperated more frequently than subjects paid on a joint basis of division and firm profits. Subjects did not become more cooperative over three rounds of negotiating, but the rate of cooperative behavior was affected by whether subjects expected to negotiate multiple or single rounds with the same person. The results indicate the importance of a multiple negotiation time horizon, threat capacity, and incentives on negotiation behavior. \textcopyright{} 1993 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

In addition to determining sequential boundaries using an alpha spending function, the program can perform power computations, compute probabilities associated with a given set of boundaries, and generate confidence intervals.},

Although I do not find that more readable disclosures directly increase perceptions ofmanagement credibility, I do find evidence of an indirect effect operating through feelings of process- ing fluency. In supplemental analyses, I find that investors who receive more readable disclosures revise their valuation judgments to be less extreme when they are explicitly made aware of the potential for variation in readability.

A systematic search of PsycINFO and Web of Knowledge databases between 1997 and 2010 identified 7,167 English-language articles yielding 241 data sets, which reported on 50 conceptually distinct correlates of GPA, including 3 demographic factors and 5 traditional measures of cognitive capacity or prior academic performance. In addition, 42 non-intellective constructs were identified from 5 conceptually overlapping but distinct research domains: (a) personality traits, (b) motivational factors, (c) self-regulatory learning strategies, (d) students' approaches to learning, and (e) psychosocial contextual influences. We retrieved 1,105 independent correlations and analyzed data using hypothesis-driven, random-effects meta-analyses. Significant average, weighted correlations were found for 41 of 50 measures. Univariate analyses revealed that demographic and psychosocial contextual factors generated, at best, small correlations with GPA. Medium-sized correlations were observed for high school GPA, SAT, ACT, and A level scores. Three non-intellective constructs also showed medium-sized correlations with GPA: academic self-efficacy, grade goal, and effort regulation. A large correlation was observed for performance self-efficacy, which was the strongest correlate (of 50 measures) followed by high school GPA, ACT, and grade goal. Implications for future research, student assessment, and intervention design are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).},

This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables\textemdash colliders and mediators\textemdash should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.},

In analyses with nonlinear models, unmodeled variability from the selection of items or participants may lead to asymptotically biased estimation. This asymptotic bias, in turn, renders inference problematic. We show, for example, that a signal detection analysis of recognition memory data leads to asymptotic underestimation of sensitivity. To eliminate asymptotic bias, we advocate hierarchical models in which participant variability, item variability, and measurement error are modeled simultaneously. By accounting for multiple sources of variability, hierarchical models yield consistent and accurate estimates of participant and item effects in recognition memory.

We find theory-consistent evidence that the goal-congruent design or redesign of accounting and participation practices in general, and of RA in particular, depends on the magnitude, scope, and speed of organizational process change. When there is a change in the magnitude, scope, and speed of organizational process change, we find that the measurability of RC managers' financial performance can change, and we also find that using RA to manage RC boundaries is an important mechanism for achieving goal-congruent behavior and avoiding dysfunctional behavior. Moreover, we show that several accounting and participation practices (e.g., activity-based costing, open book accounting, project budgeting, cross-functional teams) support RC boundary management that involves framing or reframing RC boundaries so as to influence competitive or cooperative behavior among RC managers. Finally, this study contributes by introducing a new research method to the accounting literature that is effective in structuring and interpreting longitudinal field data in relation to theoretical expectations. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This literature relates the adoption of these systems by start-ups to internal and external contingency factors. The aims of this study are twofold: i) to explore how different causal conditions related to these factors combine in explaining the use of MCS, and ii) how these combinations of causal conditions differ when comparing the MCS that relate to planning with those that relate to evaluation. Based on survey data from a sample of high-tech start-ups, this study seeks to meet these objectives through quantitative and qualitative research methods. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the adoption of MCS by start-ups. The findings demonstrate the relevance of the configurational analytical technique when simultaneously exploring the internal and external factors that lead to adoption.},

This leads to a second trade-off: environmental outcome is maximized at some inter- mediate level of contract incentivization, but cost-ef- fectiveness at 100\%. Tendering such contracts can yield additional benefits in terms of both environmen- tal outcome and cost-effectiveness. However, these benefits decline rapidly with rising incentivization},

In particular, entrepreneurial, market, and learning orientations have received thorough theoretical and empirical research attention. In this meta-analysis, we compare the direct and combined performance effects of these orientations, explore their interrelatedness, and provide a theoretical foundation for complementarity between the three. Building on prior empirical findings from 210 samples and using structural equation modeling and seemingly unrelated regression techniques, we extend the knowledge base on strategic orientations. Our results provide evidence for interrelatedness and complementarity among strategic orientations, indicating that superior firm performance emerges from its capability to align entrepreneurial, market, and learning orientations. Managerial Summary Managers might be tempted to divide rather than combine their attention on various aspects of strategy, such as entrepreneurial, market, and learning orientations. Similarly, organizational culture might inhibit or promote collaboration between distinct organizational functions. We synthesize a vast body of research on firm-level strategy making and reveal that while each strategic orientation is beneficial on its own, together, the three strategic orientations create synergies that surpass the effects of individual strategic orientations. Therefore, to achieve superior performance, firms need to align their strategy making efforts to (a) monitoring changes in customer needs and competitor moves, (b) engaging in creative processes, and (c) assimilating the extensive knowledge gained from these activities.},

We suggest that the mixed results of participative budgeting research are due to incomplete models of the process. Further, we propose that researchers develop theories that tie particular antecedents of participative budgeting to specific consequences. Next, we develop a model that uses information asymmetry between local and central management as the antecedent condition and link it to: (1) participation of local managers in setting their budgets, (2) budget-based incentives and (3) firm-wide performance. Data to test these relationships were gathered from corporate controllers of the Standard and Poor's 500, and the relationships were tested using path analysis. Three of the four hypotheses were supported\~A\^A\^Athe effects of information asymmetry on participative budgeting, participative budgeting on budget-based incentives and the effect of budget-based incentives on firm-wide performance. The fourth hypothesis-the effects of information asymmetry on budget-based incentives was only marginally supported. We also propose three other possible antecedents of participative budgeting that can be investigated: (1) a desire to positively influence individual attitudes, behavior and performance, (2) to reinforce a particular culture, and (3) to provide a mechanism tor organizational learning.

We find that, given average grant levels during our sample period, a 10\% increase in new options granted leads to a 2.8\% to 4.2\% increase in equity volatility. This increase in risk is driven largely by increased leverage.},

The "cognitive maps" of hazards produced by the paradigm seem to explain how laypeople perceive the various risks they face. Because most of the studies used aggregated data, analyzed using principal component analysis, it is not known whether the model neglects individual differences in risk perception. There has been much criticism on the fact that few studies have examined individual differences in the cognitive representation of hazards. In order to detect and describe the internal structure of the three-way data, we conducted a three-way component analysis (3MPCA). Data for the present analysis were derived from a mail survey conducted in Switzerland. Participants were asked to judge 9 attributes for 26 hazards. Individual differences in the cognitive representation of hazards were correlated with external variables (e.g., general trust). The results suggest that methods permitting individual differences should be used more frequently and that utilizing different methods could provide greater insight into the cognitive representation of risks.},

In this study, we explore the design of optimal incentive systems that induce task-related effort, helping, and knowledge sharing within workgroups. We identify three distinct types of employee linkages that must be accommodated in the design of effective incentive systems: (1) outcome linkages, whereby the outcome of one employee's task is influenced by that of another; (2) help linkages, whereby each employee can directly expend effort on helping another; and (3) knowledge linkages, whereby each employee can share job-related knowledge with another. We analytically investigate the effect of each type of employee linkage, and some combinations of these linkages, on the optimal design of incentive systems. Our analytical results demonstrate how, by optimally weighting individual-level and workgroup-level incentives, managers can balance the need to induce cooperation and coordination among employees with the need to manage employees' incentive-related risk. Counter to conventional wisdom, we also demonstrate that both group and individual incentives are necessary to facilitate cooperative behaviors such as knowledge sharing in workgroups. Further, we empirically test some of the insights developed from the analytical models; our empirical findings support these analytical results.},

They tested this notion using data from 1,944 employees working at 107 different hotels and found that Black employees rated their managers as demonstrating lower BI than did non-Black employees. Mediation analyses were consistent with the notion that these differences in perceived BI in turn account for cross-race differences in trust in management, interpersonal justice, commitment, satisfaction, and intent to stay. Results of hierarchical linear modeling were consistent with the idea that middle managers' perceptions of their senior managers' BI "trickle down" to affect line employee perceptions of the middle managers and that this trickle-down effect is stronger for Black employees. The authors interpret these results as indicative of heightened sensitivity to managers' BI on the part of Black employees. They also found a reverse in-group effect, in that Black employees were substantially more critical of Black managers than were non-Black employees.},

The principal finding that emerged from the study is that wage was the main direct determinant of labour productivity. Moreover, the relationship between ICT and its complementarities and productivity has been established indirectly, mainly by enterprise workers' use of the ICT. The results of the investigation bridge the gap in insufficient academic research about Eastern European countries, extend existing research on the company-level labour productivity determinants and enable comparison of the results at the international level.},

An important path through which cultural differences can impact acquisition performance is through employee resistance. We assemble detailed survey data to examine how acquiring firms' use of integration controls moderates the impact of employee resistance following from cultural differences on acquisition performance. Our findings confirm that cultural differences between acquirer and target are associated with initial employee resistance, which in turn depresses acquisition performance. Managers' use of integration controls moderates the effects of employee resistance on acquisition performance. Specifically, while use of task integration controls is positively associated with performance, it also amplifies the detrimental effects of resistance. In contrast, use of sociocultural integration controls helps to reduce these effects. Our findings thus indicate that in the presence of cultural differences, sociocultural integration gains importance to reduce initial employee resistance, which can enhance the effectiveness of subsequent task integration efforts.},

  abstract = {Groups of humans routinely misassign value to complex future events, especially in settings involving the exchange of resources. If properly structured, experimental markets can act as excellent probes of human group-level valuation mechanisms during pathological overvaluations\textemdash price bubbles. The connection between the behavioral and neural underpinnings of such phenomena has been absent, in part due to a lack of enabling technology. We used a multisubject functional MRI paradigm to measure neural activity in human subjects participating in experimental asset markets in which endogenous price bubbles formed and crashed. Although many ideas exist about how and why such bubbles may form and how to identify them, our experiment provided a window on the connection between neural responses and behavioral acts (buying and selling) that created the bubbles. We show that aggregate neural activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) tracks the price bubble and that NAcc activity aggregated within a market predicts future price changes and crashes. Furthermore, the lowest-earning subjects express a stronger tendency to buy as a function of measured NAcc activity. Conversely, we report a signal in the anterior insular cortex in the highest earners that precedes the impending price peak, is associated with a higher propensity to sell in high earners, and that may represent a neural early warning signal in these subjects. Such markets could be a model system to understand neural and behavior mechanisms in other settings where emergent group-level activity exhibits mistaken belief or valuation.},

While several studies have examined pairwise (`dyadic') complementarities in control practices to investigate whether a control system exists, control systems may also be comprised of more than two control practices (`nondyadic systems'). We examine whether organizations use a complementary system of three performance measurement uses to mitigate the control problem of effort direction. We illustrate how a nondyadic control system can be modeled and empirically examined using data from 162 organizational units in the public sector. Our findings are consistent with our hypothesis that operational, incentive-oriented, and exploratory uses of performance information are complementary and combine in a single system in a low contractibility setting. We also show that the intensity of use of this nondyadic control system is significantly correlated with effort direction effectiveness in conditions of low contractibility. In contrast, and consistent with our theory, we find that when contractibility is high, the combination of the three uses of performance measures is not correlated with effort direction. Jointly, our results suggest that multiple performance measurement uses combine as a nondyadic system to guide effort direction in a low contractibility setting, yet not in a high contractibility setting.},

We examine a moral solution to this moral hazard problem. In particular, we present a principal-agent model where the agent possesses some level of moral sensitivity that causes him disutility if he provides less than the agreed-upon level of effort. We examine the interplay between moral sensitivity and firm productivity in determining the optimal salary contract, and contrast our moral solution with the traditional incentive solution that becomes necessary when moral sensitivity is assumed to be zero. This allows us to highlight the benefits of the agent's moral sensitivity to both the principal and the agent, and thereby, point out the potential cost of ignoring this moral sensitivity. We conclude that adding moral sensitivity increases the descriptive, prescriptive, and pedagogical usefulness of the principal-agent model.},

Safety Indicators for management and organisation have an ambiguous relationship with latent errors and conditions, being mentioned over and over in retrospective safety analyses of major accidents.

The study hypothesizes that corporate performance is improved when the firm simultaneously exploits a complementary set of related knowledge resources across its business units. In a sample of 303 multibusiness firms, the study finds that synergies arising from product knowledge relatedness, customer knowledge relatedness, or managerial knowledge relatedness do not improve corporate performance on their own.

These effects persist even after the controls are changed, so that the effects of current controls can be strongly influenced by past control strength. Our results support those who are incorporating psychological factors into principal-agent models (such as Fischer and Huddart [2008]), and suggest that those models should be further modified to incorporate correlations between personal norms and conformity to descriptive norms.},

We find that when relationships are not allowed to influence the matching process, there are more economically optimal agreements, a larger market surplus, and more search activity. In Study 2, a simulation of a naturally occurring market selection process provides additional quantitative support for the findings from Study 1 and offers qualitative data on the reasoning process behind partner selection, including the social factors that are influential in this decision. Study 3 utilizes a repeated trial experimental simulation to offer further support for the negative relationship between relationships and economic outcomes and to suggest that the relative power of the negotiators influences the extent to which relationships help versus hurt individual profitability.

  abstract = {Organizations are increasingly turning toward personnel selection tools that rely on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and machine learning algorithms that, together, intend to predict the future success of employees better than traditional tools.  These new forms of assessment include online games, video-based interviews, and the use of large amounts of big data pulled from many sources, including test responses, test-taking behavior, applications, resumes, and social media.  Speedy processing, lower costs, convenient access, and applicant engagement are often and rightfully cited as the practical advantages for using these selection tools.  At the same time, however, these tools raise serious concerns about their effectiveness in terms their conceptual relevance to the job; their basis in a job analysis to ensure job relevancy; their measurement characteristics (reliability and stability); their validity in predicting employee-relevant outcomes; their evidence and normative information being updated appropriately; and the associated ethical concerns around what information is being represented to employers and told to job candidates.  This paper explores these concerns, concluding with an urgent call to industrial and organizational psychologists to extend existing professional standards for employment testing to these new AI and machine learning based forms of testing, including standards and requirements for their documentation.},

Like statistical power analysis for primary studies, power analysis for meta-analysis can be done either prospectively or retrospectively and requires assumptions about parameters that are unknown. The authors provide some suggestions for thinking about these parameters, in particular for the random effects variance component. The authors also show how the typically uninformative retrospective power analysis can be made more informative. The authors then discuss the value of confidence intervals, show how they could be used in addition to or instead of retrospective power analysis, and also demonstrate that confidence intervals can convey information more effectively in some situations than power analyses alone. Finally, the authors take up the question ''How many studies do you need to do a meta-analysis?'' and show that, given the need for a conclusion, the answer is ''two studies,'' because all other synthesis techniques are less transparent and/or are less likely to be valid. For systematic reviewers who choose not to conduct a quantitative synthesis, the authors provide suggestions for both highlighting the current limitations in the research base and for displaying the characteristics and results of studies that were found to meet inclusion criteria.},

Based on social exchange theory and recent literature on information processing, we expect that buyers with detailed TCO information and less power than their negotiation partners may try to (re)gain control over their own outcomes by sharing information. The results of our experiment indicate that the performance disadvantage of less powerful buyers is less pronounced when the buyer has detailed TCO information, whereas more powerful buyers do not seem to be able to profit from TCO information. These somewhat counterintuitive findings are explained through detailed analysis of the buyer's negotiation behavior, which shows that less powerful buyers who have access to TCO data use problem solving techniques more frequently than powerful buyers, who tend to rely on distributive bargaining techniques instead. We conclude that power can motivate a failure to share TCO information, resulting in less effective interfirm negotiation outcomes. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In theory, RTS is difficult to exploit because it begins with a small investment in an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG). When its cooperation is reciprocated, RTS increases its generosity, thereby taking advantage of cooperative opportunities. Previous research has shown that human participants indeed adopt RTS but start out moderately cooperative rather than with a minimal investment. This raises the question how robust RTS is against exploitation, especially in a noisy situation. We investigate whether human participants vary their cooperation in interaction with reciprocators and cheaters in an iterated nondiscrete version of a PDG. When confronted with a strategy that matches the investment of the participant on the previous round, we find that participants are likely to increase cooperation. However, cooperation gradually breaks down in interaction with a strategy that undercuts the level of cooperation of the participants, indicating the robustness of RTS. In line with RTS modeling studies, but in contrast with the cheater detection literature, we find that human participants are less willing to increase cooperation when the perceived likelihood of mistakes increases. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

This paper examines three way s to defined and test this concept of fit: Selection, Interaction, and Systems approaches. A critical discussion of these three approaches will clarify much of the current confusion in the literature on contingency theories, and suggest ways that future theorizing and research can become more systematic and constructive.},

We use the Levers of Control (LoC) framework to examine the relationships between a system of controls, empowerment, and creativity. Using survey data from 233 Business Unit managers, a structural equation model shows that the intensity of use of a LoC system of controls is positively associated with both empowerment and creativity. The implication is that the LoC system provides an environment that is rich with information and motivates employees to take action in directed ways. This environment facilitates employees' perception that they have the ability to take actions, make decisions, and produce novel ideas. We conclude that there is not a conflict between control and creativity per se. Rather, paradoxically, creativity can flourish in the presence of control.},

For example, a table might show odds ratios for one or more exposures and also for several confounders from a single logistic regression. This can lead to mistaken interpretations of these estimates. We use causal diagrams to display the sources of the problems. Presentation of exposure and confounder effect estimates from a single model may lead to several interpretative difficulties, inviting confusion of direct-effect estimates with total-effect estimates for covariates in the model. These effect estimates may also be confounded even though the effect estimate for the main exposure is not confounded. Interpretation of these effect estimates is further complicated by heterogeneity (variation, modification) of the exposure effect measure across covariate levels. We offer suggestions to limit potential misunderstandings when multiple effect estimates are presented, including precise distinction between total and direct effect measures from a single model, and use of multiple models tailored to yield total-effect estimates for covariates.},

Psychological Assessment, 14, 253-262] proposed an "Expectancy Valence" reinforcement learning model that estimates three latent components which are assumed to jointly determine choice behavior in the Iowa gambling task: weighing of wins versus losses, memory for past payoffs, and response consistency. In this article we explore the statistical properties of the Expectancy Valence model. We first demonstrate the difficulty of applying the model on the level of a single participant, we then propose and implement a Bayesian hierarchical estimation procedure to coherently combine information from different participants, and we finally apply the Bayesian estimation procedure to data from an experiment designed to provide a test of specific influence. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to use the levers of control framework to explore the antecedents of control systems - various facets of strategy that drive the use of controls; to explore the relations among control systems; and to explore the costs and benefits of control systems - costs in terms of consumption of a constrained resource (i.e., management attention) and benefits (i.e., learning). Using data from a survey of 122 Chief Financial Officers, this study tests a structural equation model that relates strategic risk and uncertainty to control systems (i.e., beliefs, boundary, diagnostic, and interactive control systems), which in turn are hypothesized to affect learning and attention, and ultimately firm performance. The evidence suggests that there are multiple inter-dependent and complementary relations among the control systems. I find that strategic risk and uncertainty drive both the importance and use of performance measures in diagnostic or interactive roles. Moreover, it appears that in certain strategic conditions information processing needs are such that firms use performance measures both interactively and diagnostically. Finally, I conclude that although there is a cost of control, there is a positive effect on firm performance. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Indeed, if transaction costs are negligible, the organization of economic activity is irrelevant, since any advantages one mode of organization appears to hold over another will simply be eliminated by costless contracting. But despite the growing reali- zation that transaction costs are central to the study of economics,1 skeptics remain. Stanley Fischer's complaint is typical: "Transaction costs have a well-deserved bad name as a theoretical device . . . partly because there is a suspicion that almost anything can be rationalized by invoking suitably specified transaction costs."2 Put differently, there are too many degrees of freedom; the concept wants for definition.},

I then survey academics in each discipline. Survey questions were designed to evaluate overall perceptions of the review process; changes in the review process in the last 5 years; opinions about appropriate acceptance rates; assessment of reviewers and editors; and general assessments of reviewers and the review process, faculty evaluation, and journals. While there are many results, key results for the accounting discipline include very low citation patterns relative to other disciplines, a belief that reviewers have not improved in the last 5 years, a desire for acceptance rates twice as high at the top-tier journals, and that reviewers focus too much on incremental contribution and rigor and not enough on research that contributes to practice. Additional results are presented and discussed.},

The purchase price of materials and components for the new product provides only part of the picture for design and sourcing decisions. All-encompassing analyses of cost and performance, such as total cost of ownership, are extraordinarily difficult to implement because they are demanding in terms of time, data and cooperation. We study monetary quantification of points of difference, which enables an NPD team to base its decisions instead on more focused, strategically-pertinent analyses of costs and performance. We propose a substantive model of its antecedents and consequences. We then test this model with data from matched samples of 144 project leaders and 144 cost analysts who participated in the same NPD projects. Using structural equation modeling, we also test hypothesized differences in perspectives between project leaders and cost analysts. Results demonstrate the pivotal role of monetary quantification of points of difference among the sourcing alternatives being considered, especially for cost analysts. Results also demonstrate that Decision Justification to senior management drives the NPD team's decision-making process. Finally, monetary quantification of points of difference leads to Uncertainty Reduction, which is found to be the primary antecedent of the judged success of applying analysis of cost and performance. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Viewing this shift as a natural experiment in which some workers were already working remotely before the pandemic enables us to separate the effects of firm-wide remote work from other pandemic-related confounding factors. Here, we use rich data on the emails, calendars, instant messages, video/audio calls and workweek hours of 61,182 US Microsoft employees over the first six months of 2020 to estimate the causal effects of firm-wide remote work on collaboration and communication. Our results show that firm-wide remote work caused the collaboration network of workers to become more static and siloed, with fewer bridges between disparate parts. Furthermore, there was a decrease in synchronous communication and an increase in asynchronous communication. Together, these effects may make it harder for employees to acquire and share new information across the network.},

Analytical models show that when agents can observe each other's actions and local signals, a peer reporting system with a verification mechanism using one agent's information to verify the other's and a reward for truthful whistleblowing can induce agents to report honestly and thereby help the principal achieve the first-best outcome. However, behavioral research suggests that the agents' perception regarding the fairness of the principal, as well as communication among agents, may affect how honestly agents report. The results of my experiment show that, under a peer reporting system with a high reward for whistleblowing, the agents' per- ception regarding the fairness of the principal positively affects the agents' reporting honesty and negatively affects their explicit attempts at collusion. Communication be- tween agents decreases their reporting honesty when the principal is perceived as unfair, but not when the principal is perceived as fair.},
