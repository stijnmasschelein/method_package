This repository contains all the files for 6 lectures and 4 assignments for the unit FINA4590 Research Methods in Accounting and Finance. 

# Lectures
## Lecture 1

The first lecture introduces the practical arrangement of the unit and explains the assessments. I introduce the research process with CEO compensation data for the largest public US firms. I also provide a number of resources for the literature review and a first introduction to R, Rstudio, and Rmarkdown.

### TODO list

- [x] Dates of assessments for 2022
- [x] Add resources
- [x] Section on workload management

## Lecture 2

The second lecture revisits the CEO compensation data and a new theory to predict the relation between firm size and total CEO compensation. We also look at the incentives of CEOs. The main question I focus on wether CEOs are paid for every $ in value creation or for a % in value creation. This leads to hypotheses about the relation between the sensitivity of pay to performance. I introduce how we can statistically test these hypotheses.

## Lecture 3

The section discusses variables we want to control for (confounders) and the specific controls of fixed effects. It also discusses the problem of bad controls (colliders). Finally, I introduce two stage least squares with an instrumental variable as an alternative.

### TODO

- [] Update the initial example for DAGs with an example from the seminar
- [] Update IV diagnostics 
- [] Explanation of negative Rsquared with IV
